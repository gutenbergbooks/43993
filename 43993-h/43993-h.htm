INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<h4>
I. THE STORY
</h4>

<p>
In order to understand the structure of the
<i>Iliad</i>, we must keep fast hold of the guiding
clue which is supplied by the author in the first
line of his poem.  The subject, he tells us, is the
<i>Wrath of Achilles</i>.  The motive of the greatest of
epics is <i>wrath</i>&mdash;blind, unreasoning fury, which knows
no law, and acknowledges no right.  Keeping this
in view, we are able to explain what seems at first
sight to be a strange anomaly in the conduct of the
story&mdash;the absence of the hero from the scene of
action during three-fourths of the narrative.  For
Achilles is not less the hero of the <i>Iliad</i> than
Odysseus is the hero of the <i>Odyssey</i>, and in both
cases the character of the man determines the
structure of the poem.  Odysseus is a man of
middle age, in the maturity of his splendid powers,
with his judgment refined by experience, and his
passions cooled by time.  From the moment when
he sets sail from Troy he remains faithful to the
fixed desire of his heart.  All the malice of Poseidon,
all the spells of Circe, all the loveliness of Calypso,
cannot shake him from his resolve to return to
his home in Ithaca, and live out his life in calm
domestic happiness and peace.  Yet he is entirely
free from the narrowness which commonly belongs
to a fixed idea.  He knows the uncertainty which
attaches to all human hopes, and is as ready to
enjoy the passing hour as the youngest sailor of his
crew.  He has the hungry intellect, which would
fain take all knowledge into its compass, and the
spirit of soaring enterprise, which delights in
discovery and daring adventure.  But above all he
has the patient, constant human heart, faithful
through all turns of fortune to one sober ideal.  It
is this steadfastness of purpose and sweet
reasonableness in the hero which gives to the narrative
of the <i>Odyssey</i> its smooth and pellucid flow,
and makes it the most delightful of all story-books.
</p>

<p>
Achilles, on the other hand, is the incarnation
of the spirit of youth, with its passionate pride, its
acute sensibility, and its absorption in self.  He is
like one of the great forces of nature&mdash;unreasoning,
elemental, mighty to create or destroy.  His
inaction is as tremendous as his action.  He is
offended, and the Greeks, deprived of his aid, are
brought to the brink of ruin&mdash;his friend is slain by
Hector, and the current of his fury, thus directed
into a new channel, sweeps the whole Trojan army
before it in havoc and rout.
</p>

<p>
This, then, is the plan of the <i>Iliad</i>&mdash;to describe
the effects of Achilles' anger, first on the Greeks,
then on the Trojans.  A brief review of the story
will show how the plan is worked out.  In the
ninth year of the war, the Greeks have taken a
small town in the neighbourhood of Troy, and
Agamemnon has received a maiden named Chryseis
as his share of the spoil.  Chryses, the maiden's
father, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom his
child, but he is rudely repulsed by Agamemnon,
and invokes the vengeance of Apollo, whose priest
he is, on the Greeks.  Apollo sends a pestilence on
the camp, and Agamemnon is compelled in
consequence to restore Chryseis, but he recompenses
himself by seizing another maiden, named Briseis,
awarded to Achilles as a prize at the capture of the
same city.  Achilles vows vengeance on the whole
Greek army for this outrage, and Thetis, his mother,
obtains a promise from Zeus, the supreme god of
Olympus, that her son's vow shall be fulfilled to
the letter.  Accordingly Zeus sends a false dream
to Agamemnon, bidding him lead the whole army
against Troy, with the assurance of a decisive
victory.  Agamemnon obeys the summons in all
good faith, and the two armies meet on the plain
before the city.  But just as the general encounter
is about to begin, Paris offers to meet Menelaus
in single combat, and a truce is made in order
that the duel may take place.  They fight,
and Menelaus is victorious, but Paris is saved
from death or capture by the intervention of
Aphrodite.
</p>

<p>
Menelaus now claims the fulfilment of the
conditions of the truce&mdash;the restoration of Helen with
all her wealth.  But before the point can be debated,
Pandarus, a Trojan, at the instigation of Athene,
aims an arrow at Menelaus, and wounds him in the
side.  This treacherous act leads to an immediate
renewal of hostilities, and in the battle which follows
the Trojans are reduced to such straits by the
powers of Diomede that Hector goes on a mission
to the city, to institute a solemn supplication in the
temple of Athene, in the vain hope of diverting her
anger from the Trojans.  Having accomplished his
errand, he returns to the field, bringing with him
Paris, who, since his defeat by Menelaus, has been
dallying in Helen's bower; and then follows a duel
between Hector and Ajax, in which the Greek
champion has the advantage.  At the suggestion
of Nestor, the Greeks fortify their camp with a
moat and rampart; and this brings us to the end
of the seventh book.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto the Greeks have had a decided
advantage in battle with the Trojans, and nothing
has been done to carry out the promise which Zeus
made to Thetis.  But now the father of gods and
men begins to take decisive measures to fulfil his
pledge; the gods are forbidden to interfere between
the rival armies, and in the next day's battle the
Greeks are driven back in panic to their camp,
while the Trojans, contrary to their custom, keep
the field all night, intending to attack the Greek
stronghold in full force next day.  So despondent
are the Greeks that an embassy is sent with an
offer of magnificent gifts to Achilles, if he will lay
aside his anger and come to the help of his
distressed countrymen.  Achilles refuses all compromise,
and the rest of the night is occupied by the bold
raid undertaken by Diomede and Odysseus on the
Thracian camp.
</p>

<p>
At the opening of the eleventh book our attention
is concentrated on the valorous exploits of
Agamemnon, who is at length compelled to retire by
a severe wound in the arm; Diomede is pierced
through the foot by an arrow from the bow of Paris,
and Odysseus, Machaon, and Eurypylus are also
disabled.  Patroclus is sent by Achilles to inquire
of Nestor concerning the fortunes of the Greeks,
and Nestor then makes the suggestion which marks
the turning-point in the first act of the great epic
drama: if, he says, Achilles will not go to the field
himself, at least let him send Patroclus to lead the
Myrmidons[<a id="chap00bfn1text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn1">1</a>] against the Trojans.  Nothing comes
of the proposal for the present, but it is to bear
fatal fruit both for Patroclus and Achilles in the
near future.  The Greeks are again driven behind
their defences, and a furious struggle ensues, at the
end of which the gates of the camp are demolished,
and the Trojans, led by Hector, are on the point of
setting fire to the ships.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap00bfn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap00bfn1text">1</a>] The followers of Achilles
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At this moment the attention of Zeus is
withdrawn from the battle, and Poseidon seizes the
opportunity to interfere in favour of the Greeks.
By his influence the scale is turned again, Hector
receives fearful injuries from a huge stone hurled
by Ajax, and the Trojans are driven headlong
across the plain.  Zeus is lulled to sleep by the
contrivance of Hera, and when he awakens it is to find
his whole scheme of vengeance on the point of being
frustrated.  In great anger he sends a peremptory
message to Poseidon to withdraw from the battle,
and lays his commands on Apollo, who brings back
Hector, healed and whole, to the field, and leads
the Trojans once more to the assault of the camp.
In spite of the desperate valour of Ajax, the Greeks
are driven back to their ships, and the Trojans
bring torches, with the intention of burning the
whole fleet.
</p>

<p>
Then at last Achilles, yielding to the earnest
entreaty of Patroclus, sends him to the aid of the
Greeks, equipped in his own armour, and leading
the whole force of the Myrmidons.  Patroclus easily
drives the Trojans back from the camp, and slays
Sarpedon, one of the bravest warriors among the
allies of Troy; but he himself falls by Hector's
hand, and the armour of Achilles passes into the
possession of his slayer.  A tremendous struggle
ensues over the body of Patroclus, which is only
ended by the appearance of Achilles himself, who
comes, attended by strange prodigies, to the wall,
and, by the mere terror of his presence, scares the
Trojans from the field, and saves his friend's body
from outrage.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the story may be briefly told.  By
the intercession of Thetis, HephÃ¦stus, the divine
smith, makes a splendid suit of armour for Achilles,
and, after a solemn scene of reconciliation with
Agamemnon, Achilles leads the Greeks to battle.
The whole torrent of his fury is now turned upon
the Trojans, and, after a wholesale massacre of lesser
victims, he meets Hector in single combat, slays
him, and drags his body behind his chariot to the
camp.  The funeral obsequies of Patroclus are
celebrated with great pomp, and then Achilles, who
is possessed by a demon of rage and grief,
continues for a space of twelve days to wreak his
vengeance on the lifeless body of Hector, which he
drags repeatedly behind his car round the tomb of
Patroclus.  The gods interpose to make an end of
this senseless fury, and Hector's body, which has
been miraculously preserved from harm, is restored
to Priam, who comes in the night, under the
conduct of Hermes, and redeems the corpse with a
heavy ransom.  With the burial of Hector the poem
reaches its conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Such, in the briefest and baldest outline, is the
story of the <i>Iliad</i>.  Space does not allow us to
discuss the various objections which have been raised
against some of the details of the narrative, still less
to enumerate the reconstructions and mutilations
to which the great epic has been subjected in the
dissecting-room of criticism.  Where opinion is
still so much divided, we may be allowed to state
our conviction that the <i>Iliad</i>, though wanting the
structural perfection of the <i>Odyssey</i>, is one poem,
and the work of one master mind.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II. THE DIVINE CHARACTERS
</h4>

<p>
The gods in the <i>Iliad</i> play a very active and
human part, and indeed they may be said in a
sense to be more human than the men themselves.
They are passionate, sensual, vindictive; they have
no sense of fair play, but are always ready to help
their favourites by all means, fair or foul.  When
Patroclus is to die, he is stripped of his armour and
beaten half senseless by Apollo, and delivered over
in this helpless state to Euphorbus and Hector; and
Hector, in his turn, is cheated and beguiled to his
death by Athene.  In the chariot race which is
described in the twenty-third book Athene wrecks the
car of Eumelus to secure the victory for Diomede;
and the same goddess interferes in the foot race on
behalf of Odysseus, whom she loves like a mother.
We have already remarked, in the Introduction to
the <i>Odyssey</i>, that the only humorous scenes in the
<i>Iliad</i> are those in which the gods play the chief or
sole part.  And, in fact, the want of dignity and
decorum which we find in these mighty beings is
simply astonishing.  The battle of the gods, which
is introduced with such pomp and parade, ends in
the broadest farce.  In the fifth book, Ares roars
and bellows like a beast when he is wounded by
the spear of Diomede, and Aphrodite, whose hand
has been scratched, goes whimpering and whining
to her mother for comfort.  Only in a few passages
do we find a great and worthy conception of the
divine nature&mdash;as in the famous lines in the first
book, when Zeus nods his immortal head confirming
his oath to Thetis, and in the sublime description
of Poseidon at the beginning of the thirteenth book.
</p>

<p>
At the head of the Olympian hierarchy stands
Zeus the lord of the sky, who divides with his
brothers, Hades and Poseidon, the empire of the
universe.  He is the highest in power and authority,
and with him rests the final decision in all the
disputes of Olympus.  But this genial and
patriarchal deity is not without his troubles: he rules
over a disorderly household, and his purposes are
constantly thwarted by the lesser powers who reign
under him.  In his heart of hearts he favours Priam
and the Trojans, but he is a fond and indulgent
father and husband, and Hera, his wife, and Athene,
his daughter, cherish an implacable hatred against
Troy and all things Trojan.  The reason for this
bitter animosity does not appear: for the judgment
of Paris, which is the cause assigned by later
legends, is only mentioned in one passage, of
doubtful authenticity.  Hera is described as a lady of
shrewish and vixenish temper; she will never be
satisfied, says Zeus, until she has gone down into
Troy and eaten Priam and all his people raw!
Her human counterpart is Hecuba, who would like,
she says, to tear out the heart of Achilles, and devour
it.  On the side of the Trojans are Apollo, Artemis,
HephÃ¦stus, the river-god Scamander, and Leto.
</p>

<p>
Such are the gods of Homer, and such the
national divinities of Greece.  For the poems of
Homer and Hesiod, as Herodotus informs us, are
the chief sources of the popular theology.  Small
wonder, then, that the more earnest minds of a
later age were much occupied by the endeavour to
raise and purify the accepted mythology, or that
Plato excludes Homer, "the great magician," from
his scheme of reformed education.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III. THE HUMAN CHARACTERS
</h4>

<p>
Of Achilles and Odysseus we have already spoken
at some length, so that we have only to notice
briefly the other chief characters.  At the head of
the Greek army stands Agamemnon, whose authority
rests on his personal prowess, his vast wealth, and
the extent of his dominions.  In the absence of
Achilles he shares with Ajax and Diomede the
highest place among the warriors of Greece.  A
certain strain of weakness runs through his character.
He is jealous of his authority, and somewhat covetous,
and at moments of crisis and peril he is always
foremost in the counsels of despair.  Next to him
in rank comes Menelaus, his brother, an amiable but
somewhat feeble prince, to whom the poet shows a
certain playful tenderness, such as is felt by
chivalrous natures towards a woman or a child.
</p>

<p>
The most knightly figure on the Greek side is
the young Diomede, whose wonderful exploits fill
so large a space in the earlier part of the poem.
His gallant and buoyant spirit shines brightest
when the fortunes of the Greeks are at their lowest
ebb; and the beautiful episode of his meeting with
Glaucus on the battlefield is a rare exception to the
savage ferocity of Homeric warfare.
</p>

<p>
After Achilles, the mightiest champion of Greece
is the great Telamonian Ajax.  He is a giant in
stature and strength, and is the chief bulwark of
the Greeks against the impetuous valour of Hector.
In character, he is modest and unassuming; he
lacks the brilliant qualities of Achilles, though equal
to him in sheer physical force.  He is the type of
the rugged soldier, such as we find among the
Spartans of a later date, loyal to his prince, a
faithful comrade, ever at the post of danger, ever prompt
to help where the need is sorest.  His plain, frank
nature views with contempt the fantastic pride of
Achilles, whose frightful egoism, and indifference to
the sufferings of his countrymen, revolt and disgust
him.

<br />
The Leaders of the Greeks (Christian G. Heyne)
</p>

<p>
This list may fitly be closed with the name of
Nestor, "the clear-voiced orator, from whose lips
flowed eloquence sweeter than honey."  As becomes
his age, he assumes the office of peacemaker
between Agamemnon and Achilles; in spite of his
eighty years, he still takes the field and fights in
the van, though his arm is now of less value than
his head.  With regard to his eloquence, it can
hardly be said, judging by the specimen preserved,
that he is quite worthy of his reputation.  He is, in
fact, garrulous, rambling, and tedious&mdash;though in
these qualities he is even surpassed by the aged
Ph&oelig;nix, who has played the part of male nurse to
Achilles, and excels in a style of oratory dear to the
professional guardians of childhood.
</p>

<p>
The great champion of the Trojans is Hector,
the son of Priam and Hecuba.  His character is,
in every respect, a contrast to that of Achilles.
With him the claims of king and country ever come
first, though he is not indifferent to personal
distinction.  He falls very far short of the ideal
knight&mdash;without fear and without reproach.  In these
qualities he seems to be eclipsed by Glaucus and
Sarpedon, the princes of Lycia, whose beautiful
friendship finds its most illustrious record in the
immortal lines of the twelfth book,[<a id="chap00bfn2text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn2">2</a>] the finest
exposition in the world of the principle involved
in the words <i>noblesse oblige</i>.  Hector, on the other
hand, is full of weakness: at one time he is
faint-hearted, and has to be recalled to the duties of his
great position by the reproaches of those who
serve under him; at another time he is overbold,
and his rashness brings upon the Trojans overwhelming
disaster.  Yet with all this, his character
is full of interest.  In his greater moments he
rises to sublime heights of heroism.  He does not
shrink from the consequences of his actions, but
goes to certain death with the spirit of a patriot and
martyr.  He is the mirror of knightly courtesy,
kind and gentle even to the guilty and the fallen;
and his last meeting with Andromache is hardly to
be matched for beauty and pathos in all literature.

A bare mention must suffice for Priam, the
white-haired King, and the most tragic figure in the
poem; Paris, the curled darling of Aphrodite, a
mere beautiful animal, without soul or conscience,
and the lovely passion-stricken Helen, whose
strange story seems to have a closer affinity
with mediÃ¦val romance than with classical antiquity.

<h4>
IV. THE SIMILES
</h4>

<p>
One word must be added on the frequent
comparisons, or similes, which form one of the most
characteristic features of the poem.  At least half
the <i>Iliad</i> is occupied with descriptions of battle,
and Homeric warfare is exceedingly simple and
uniform, consisting almost entirely of single combats
between individual chieftains, or wholesale slaughter
wrought by some puissant arm on the promiscuous
herd of soldiers.  To render so unpromising a theme
interesting and attractive must have taxed the skill
and invention of the poet to their utmost limit; and
his principal resources for attaining this end is in
the lavish use of the simile.  In those parts of the
poem where much is to be told in little space this
ornament occurs rarely, or not at all.  In the first
book, which is crowded with incidents, not a single
simile is used.  But where the action is to be
delayed or elaborated, and especially in the battle
pieces, the similes are flung broadcast, shining like
stars among the racing clouds of a stormy sky.
Every corner of nature, and every province of
human life, are ransacked to furnish illustrations
of the eternal drama of "battle, and murder, and
sudden death."  In a moment we are rapt by the
magic of the poet from the steam and squalor of
slaughter to some busy scene of human industry,
or some living picture, grand, lovely, or terrible,
drawn from the great panorama of nature.  Nothing
is too great, nothing too little, to furnish
material for this splendid treasury of poetry.  It
would be easy to discourse for pages on this
fascinating subject; but we must content ourselves with
the above brief hint, and will conclude our remarks
by declaring our full agreement with those who
regard the similes in the <i>Iliad</i> as the chief glory
and beauty in the first and greatest of epic poems.

<h2>
STORIES FROM THE ILIAD
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
The Quarrel
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The scene of our story is laid in the
north-western corner of Asia Minor, where the
blue waters of the Hellespont mingle with
the waves of the Ã†gÃ¦an.  The whole coast is
lined with a multitude of war galleys, drawn up,
row behind row, for a space of several miles; and
behind them are thousands and thousands of
wooden huts, affording shelter to a whole nation
of warriors, with their slaves and followers.  For
nine years the Greeks have lain here encamped,
striving in vain to sack the ancient city of Troy,
whose towers and battlements, some five miles
distant, can be seen from the elevated parts of
the camp.  The whole surrounding country has
been laid waste, and town after town has been
visited by all the horrors of war; but the walls of
Troy still stand firm against all assault, and the
end seems as far off as ever.
</p>

<p>
The chiefs are assembled in council, and in
their midst sits Agamemnon, the mightiest prince
in Greece, whose nod a hundred thousand warriors
obey.  Suddenly, a voice is heard on the outskirts
of the crowd which surrounds the circle of elders,
and an aged man, clad in the long flowing robes
of a priest, is led into the royal presence.  In his
hand he carries a rod, adorned with studs of gold,
and wreathed with olive leaves.  "A boon, great
king, a boon!" he cries, lifting the rod on high.
"Speak," answers Agamemnon.  "What wouldst
thou have of me?"  "Give me back my child, my
daughter Chryseis," answers the priest.  "Thou
hast sacked my city, thou hast burnt my home;
restore unto me my child, and leave me not
altogether desolate in mine old age."
</p>

<p>
Dark was the brow of Agamemnon when he
heard these words, and short and stern was his
answer.  "Let me not find thee," he said,
"lingering here in the camp, and come not hither
again on such an errand.  Thy daughter thou shall
not see again; she is mine, the captive of my
bow and of my spear, and shall be my slave until
the day of her death."  In vain the old man
urged him with entreaty, and offered a rich ransom
to redeem his child from bondage.  "Talk not to
me of ransom," answered Agamemnon: "not all
the gold of thy temple shall purchase liberty for
the maiden, for she hath found favour in my sight.
Get thee gone at once, and provoke me no further."
</p>

<p>
Then the priest, whose name was Chryses,
feared for his own life, and fled from the angry
face of the King.  Down to the margin of the sea
he went, and gazing with tear-dimmed eyes over
the heaving waters, thus he prayed to Apollo, his
protector and lord: "Hear me, god of the silver
bow, whose altar steams day and night with
offerings from the choicest of the flock.  Remember my
faithful service, and let thine arrows avenge my
tears on the Greeks."
</p>

<p>
So he prayed, and Apollo heard him, and down
from the peaks of Olympus he sped.  In his hand
he bare his mighty bow, and the arrows in his
quiver made an angry rattling as he swooped down
on the Grecian camp, swift and sudden as the
southern night.  He took his stand on a hill, and
loosed an arrow from the string; and dire was the
twang of the silver bow.  First, he sent his shafts
among the dogs and mules; then he changed his
aim, and rained destruction among the men; and
the whole place was filled with the smoke of
funeral pyres.
</p>

<p>
For nine days the deadly shower fell without
ceasing; but on the tenth, Achilles summoned a
general gathering of the host, to inquire into the
causes of the calamity which had fallen on his
countrymen.  The chiefs met in full conclave, and
about them were gathered the meaner sort in their
tens of thousands.  When the clamorous cries of the
multitude were stilled, Achilles rose in his place,
and addressing himself directly to Agamemnon
said: "Son of Atreus, how long wilt thou suffer
thy people to perish?  Is it not enough that our
blood is poured forth every day in battle with thy
foes, but must pestilence also make havoc among
our ranks?  This is Apollo's work, and it is time
to ask some priest or soothsayer how we have
offended the god, that we may appease his anger
with the fat of goats and lambs, and save ourselves
from further harm."
</p>

<p>
Among the elders sat Calchas, the chief seer of
the Greeks; who knew all things&mdash;what was, and
had been, and was to come&mdash;and was the chosen
leader of the army in matters of religion.  Seeing
all eyes turned upon him he stood up and answered
the challenge of Achilles, though with manifest
reluctance and constraint.
</p>

<p>
"Illustrious chieftain," he said, "thou hast
asked the cause of Apollo's anger, and I know
that thou lookest to me for an answer.  But
swear unto me first that thou wilt defend me in
word and in deed; for I fear that, by revealing the
counsels of the god whom I serve, I shall offend
one who is the greatest and mightiest among us."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us what thou knowest, and fear nothing,"
answered Achilles; "while I live no one shall
lift his hand against thee, no, not Agamemnon
himself."
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, Calchas spoke out, and declared
that the only means of staying the pestilence was
by sending back Chryseis to her father, without
price or ransom, and offering a costly sacrifice of
atonement to Apollo in his temple at Chrysa.  It
was not without reason that the prudent seer had
appealed to Achilles for protection; for no sooner
had his words been uttered than Agamemnon
sprang from his seat, with fury in his looks, and
overwhelmed the prophet with a torrent of
reproaches.  "Ill fare thy prophecies, thou prophet
of ill!" he cried.  "Not one good word have I
ever heard from thy lips; but this is the worst that
ever thou hast spoken.  Hard and bitter is the
charge which thou hast laid upon me, bidding me
restore this maiden, fairer and dearer to me than
ClytÃ¦mnestra, my wedded wife.  Nevertheless I
will send her back, if I cannot save my people
otherwise; but look ye to it, princes and councillors
of Greece, that I find fit recompense for my loss;
for she was a choice prize of war, set apart for me
as a gift of privilege and honour."
</p>

<p>
"And thinkest thou," said Achilles, roused at
once to opposition by this unwarrantable claim,
"that it befits thine honour as a king to be
covetous of thy people's goods?  Be generous;
let thy prize go, and when next we divide the
spoil of a captured town we will repay thee
threefold and fourfold for thy loss."
</p>

<p>
"Payment I will have, and that right speedily,"
answered Agamemnon, with darkening brow.  "See
that ye find means to fill the place of this maiden,
or one of you shall yield up his prize to me, whether
it be Ajax, or Odysseus, or thou Achilles, who art
so bold of speech, that thou mayest learn that I am
king indeed.  But concerning this we can speak
again hereafter; our present task is to restore
Chryseis to her father, and appease the god with
sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon thought perhaps by his last words
to avert the anger of the fiery young prince, whose
eyes flashed fire when he heard the King's threat.
But if such was his purpose it failed altogether.
No sooner had he ended than the full tempest of
Achilles' wrath fell upon his head.  "Thou soul of
avarice!" he cried, "clad in shamelessness as with
a garment, was it for thee that we crossed all those
weary leagues of water to make war on the men
of Troy?  I have no quarrel with the Trojans;
they have not lifted my cattle, or driven off my
horses, for my home is far beyond their reach,
divided from Asia by shadowy mountains and
sounding seas.  For thee, thou dog, and for thy
brother have I toiled, and in the division of the
spoil 'tis but little that I win as the price of my
sweat and my blood; and thou seekest to rob me
of that little, to add to thine own monstrous hoard.
I will go back forthwith to my native land of
Phthia, for I have no mind to abide here in
dishonour and heap up treasure for thee."
</p>

<p>
"Go when thou wilt," answered Agamemnon, in
scornful tones.  "Heaven forbid that I should
hinder thee!  Most hateful to me art thou of
all the chivalry of Greece, for thou hast a heart
full of hatred and malice.  Go and lord it over
thine own tribe; I am the master here, and as sure
as I am a crowned and anointed king I will take
thy prize, even the maiden Briseis, and lead her to
my tent, that thou mayest learn to curb thy saucy
tongue in the presence of thy lord."
</p>

<p>
Thus publicly insulted and defied, Achilles sat
speechless with rage, fighting against the passion
which shook his mighty frame.  At last it seemed
that he had resolved to let his fury have full scope;
slowly he drew his sword from its scabbard, his
mouth was opened for the battle cry, and in another
moment the haughty King would have lain weltering
in his blood; but in the very act of springing on
his foe he felt himself restrained from behind, and
turning to confront this new assailant he stood face
to face with the goddess Athene.  Unseen and
unheard by the rest, the grey-eyed goddess spoke,
bidding him to desist from his murderous purpose.
"Put up thy sword," she said; "speak daggers
to him, if thou wilt, but use none.  Thine honour
is safe in the hands of Zeus, and the day of
reckoning shall come, when that proud head shall be
humbled to the very dust before thee."
</p>

<p>
To those who were looking on it seemed that
Achilles had fallen into a sudden trance of thought,
from which he started abruptly, and, thrusting back
his sword into its sheath, resumed the war of words
with Agamemnon.  "Thou drunkard," he cried,
"with eye of dog and heart of deer, foremost in
the revel and last in the fray!  Thou of the
itching palm, who lovest the chink of stolen gold, but
turnest pale at the clash of steel!  False shepherd,
that devourest thy flock!  Cowardly master of
cowardly sheep!  Now by this sceptre I swear, by
this symbol of justice which the elders hold in their
hands when they give judgment before the people,
the day is not far distant when all this host shall
be filled with longing for me, to save them from
Hector's destroying arm, when their bravest and
their strongest are falling beneath his spear.  Then
shalt thou learn thy folly too late, and drink to the
dregs the bitter cup which thou hast filled for me."
</p>

<p>
With that he flung the sceptre at Agamemnon's
feet, and sat down again in his place.  Then arose
Nestor, the clear-voiced orator of Pylos, from whose
lips flowed eloquence sweeter than honey.  Two
generations of men had lived and died since his
birth, and he still dwelt in kingly honour among
the third.  And thus he spake, striving to make
peace between the two angry chieftains: "Alas! what
sorrow has come upon the sons of Greece!&mdash;sorrow
to us, but joy unto Priam and the sons of
Priam, when they hear of the feud which hath arisen
between ye twain.  Be guided by me; I am older
than ye, and before ye were born I moved as an
equal among heroes mightier than ye, and was
second to none in council and in fight.  Hearken
therefore to me, even as they did.  Seek not,
Agamemnon, to take from Achilles his prize of
honour; and thou, Achilles, provoke not the King
to anger by thy bitter words, for as thou art our
bulwark in war, so he sits higher than thou in
sceptred majesty."
</p>

<p>
"Thou sayest well," answered Agamemnon, "but
this man's insolence is not to be borne.  Because he
is a stout spearman he thinks that he can lord it
over us all.  But there are some here who will not
brook his tyranny."
</p>

<p>
"There is one here," retorted Achilles, "who
refuses to be thy slave.  But enough of this&mdash;I
will waste no more words on thee.  Come and
take away my prize, if those who stand here suffer
thee to do this wrong; but touch not aught else
of my possessions, or thy blood shall pay the price."
</p>

<p>
With these words the stormy debate, so fruitful
in disaster to the Greeks, came to an end.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Agamemnon's first task, when he returned to his
tent, was to send back Chryseis, under the charge
of Odysseus, to her father.  This done, he at once
took steps to secure possession of Briseis, the
captive maiden who had been bestowed on Achilles
as his prize of honour.  Talthybius and Eurybates,
the royal heralds, were sent to the quarters of
Achilles to demand the surrender of Briseis.
"And if he will not give her up to you," added the
King, "I will come myself and take her by force."  So
they went with slow and reluctant steps on their
thankless errand; and they found Achilles sitting
alone by his ship, where it was drawn up on the
beach.  Awestruck and silent they stood in the
presence of that great chief, unable to utter a
sound; but he knew full well why they had come,
and greeted them with courtesy and kindness.
"Draw near," he said, "and fear nothing from me.
I respect your office, and impute not to you your
master's guilt.  Patroclus my comrade shall deliver
unto you the maiden, and be ye my witnesses in
this matter, when it is asked why I threw down
my sword and refused to fight any longer in
Agamemnon's cause."
</p>

<p>
So saying he summoned Patroclus, and bade him
bring forth Briseis from the tent; and Patroclus
went, and presently returned, leading the weeping
maiden by the hand, and gave her in charge of the
heralds.  When they were gone, Achilles wandered
away by the margin of the sea, nursing his wounded
spirit, and full of angry and bitter thoughts.
Presently he came to a stand, and, stretching out his
hands towards the sea, cried like a child in pain
to Thetis, his mother: "Short is the term of years
which Fate has vouchsafed to me, and therefore thou
hast promised me honour from the hands of Zeus.
But now is mine honour turned to infamy, and I am
become a very scorn of men, and an outcast among
the people."  His words were broken by sobs and
tears, for he was but a boy in years, and was
smarting with an agony of wounded pride.  And his
mother heard him where she sat in her crystal cave
in the depths of the sea; for she was a goddess,
and daughter of the sea-god, Nereus.  Swiftly
she rose, "like an exhalation," to the surface of the
sea, and came and stood by her young hero's side.
"Why weepest thou, my child?" she asked, with
a tender caress.  "Tell thy mother all thy pain,
that she may bear the burden with thee."
</p>

<p>
"Thou knowest full well," replied Achilles, with
a groan; "what boots it to repeat to thee the
story of my shame?"  Nevertheless he went on
to pour out all the tale of injury and outrage; for
sorrow grows lighter in the telling.  "Thou alone,"
he added, when he had finished the recital, "canst
heal this deadly hurt to mine honour.  I have often
heard thee boast of an old service rendered to Zeus,
when the other Olympians rose up in revolt against
him, and he was in sore straits.  Go, therefore, to
Olympus, and remind him of the debt which he
owes unto thee, and ask him in requital to lend aid
to the Trojans, that the Greeks may be hurled back
in rout upon their ships, and Agamemnon may learn
what it means to deal despitefully with the best
warrior in his camp."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be done as thou sayest," answered
Thetis; "Leave everything in my hands, and
thou shalt have atonement in full measure.  Until
twelve days are passed I can do nothing, for Zeus
has gone on a far journey, to partake of a banquet
in the land of the Ethiopians.  When he returns
I will lay thy case before him; and meanwhile sit
thou idle here, and go not into battle, but leave me
to champion thy cause."  With this promise she
left him, and he sat down to digest his anger, and
wait for the day of redress.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
On the dawn of the twelfth day Thetis rose again
from her cavern into mid-air, and was borne by the
breezes unto Olympus.  She found the lord of
heaven sitting apart on the topmost peak of the
mountain, and kneeling before him she preferred
her request.  When Zeus heard what she desired
he fell into a muse, and answered not a word; but
Thetis remained kneeling at his feet, and,
clinging to him with both hands, repeated her prayer.
Being urged thus with importunity, at last the sire
opened his mouth, and answered in heavy tones:
"Thou wilt put enmity between me and Hera, my
wife; already she upbraids me for showing favour
to the Trojans, and thou askest me to take sides
openly with them against the Greeks.  But go to,
what care I for the wrath of Hera?  Nevertheless,
get thee gone speedily, lest she find us together.
Howbeit, thou shalt have thy wish; behold, I swear
it, and confirm it with my nod, and whatsoever
I have thus confirmed cannot be annulled or
unfulfilled."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon the monarch of the sky bowed his
immortal head, with all its dark and waving locks,
and shook the mountain to its base.
</p>

<p>
Having thus attained her purpose, Thetis
departed, and as soon as she was gone Zeus joined
the assembly of the gods in the high palace of
Olympus.  All the gods rose from their seats
to pay him homage as he entered and took his
place on the royal throne.  But the sharp eyes
of Hera had spied out his conference with Thetis,
and forthwith she assailed her indulgent lord in
mocking tones: "What plot hast thou been hatching
now, thou god of craft?  I know that thou art
keeping some mischief from me, thy lawful wife."
</p>

<p>
"Daughter of Cronos," answered Zeus, avoiding
her piercing glance, "thou canst not expect that
I should share all my counsels with thee.
Whatever it is meet for thee to know thou shall learn;
but I have some secrets which are not for thy ear."
</p>

<p>
"Thou must keep thy secrets more carefully,"
said Hera, with a bitter smile, "if thou wouldst
deceive me.  Listen, ye gods, while I tell you this
fine secret!  Zeus has promised Thetis that the
Greeks shall suffer defeat, to avenge the insult put
upon her son."
</p>

<p>
"And if such be my will, who shall say me
nay?" replied Zeus, with a stern look.  "I warn
thee not to thwart my purpose, or all the gods who
sit here shall not save thee from chastisement."
</p>

<p>
Then fear fell upon Hera, and she sat biting her
lips, venturing no reply.  And all the gods sat
silent, glancing anxiously at one another, when
they heard the angry tones of the Olympian sire.
</p>

<p>
At last HephÃ¦stus, the lame god of fire, came to
his mother's relief.  Rising from his seat, he took
a goblet of nectar from the hands of Hebe, who
was serving drink to the gods, and went hobbling
to the place where Hera sat.  "Mother mine,"
said, he, as he offered her the cup, "I counsel thee
to give way, and not provoke our father to anger.
Shall we, the sons and daughters of heaven, brawl
over our cups for the sake of miserable mortals?
Let Zeus have his way&mdash;for what can we do
against him?  Hast thou forgotten how he served
me when I presumed to stand between thee and
his ire?&mdash;how he caught me by the foot, and flung
me forth from the open portals of Olympus, as a
boy slings a stone?  From morn till eve I fell, and
at the setting of the sun I struck on Lemnos, the
Ã†gÃ¦an isle."
</p>

<p>
Hera smiled at her ungainly son; and when she
had drunk of the nectar he took the cup, and went
limping round the circle of the gods, offering them
to drink.  And all the immortals laughed loud and
long, to see the huge, hairy god engaged in the
office of the lovely Hebe.  Then music and song
came to crown the banquet, as Apollo led the choir
of the Muses on his golden harp.
</p>

<h3>
The Dream: The Muster of Greeks
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Agamemnon lay sleeping in his tent,
and in a dream he saw Nestor, the son
of Neleus, who addressed him in these
words: "Sleepest thou, son of Atreus?  It is
not meet that thou, on whom lies the weight of
a mighty monarchy, shouldst slumber all night
long.  Hearken now to my words: I am the
bearer of a message from Zeus, who bids thee
summon the whole host of Greeks, and lead them
against Troy.  Her hour is come at last, and the
gods with one consent have decided that she shall
fall."
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon awoke, and behold it was a dream.
But the words had sunk deep into his heart, and he
deemed that the vision had spoken truth.  In that
vain belief he arose from his couch, clothed himself
in a fair linen tunic and a woollen robe, and, taking
his sceptre in his hand, went to rouse Nestor and
tell him his dream.  Then the whole body of the
chiefs met in council, and the heralds were sent
round to proclaim a general assembly of the army.
The people came flocking at the summons, numberless
as bees which hover round the flowers in spring;
and nine heralds went about among the multitude,
marshalling the clamorous commons in their places,
and commanding silence, that the counsel of the
King might be heard.
</p>

<p>
As this was a great occasion, it had been resolved,
in the private meeting of the elders, to try the temper
of the people before disclosing to them the real
purpose of their leaders.  Accordingly, when silence had
been obtained, Agamemnon rose up in his place,
holding in his hand his ancestral sceptre, the symbol
of his great office, which had descended from father
to son since the days of Pelops, the founder of the
royal house of Argos.  Planting the sceptre firmly
before him, and leaning upon it, thus spake the
King, to prove the heart of his people.
</p>

<p>
"Friends and comrades in war, I have heavy
news to tell you.  Zeus brought us hither under a
solemn promise that in the end we should take the
sacred city of Priam.  But now he hath revoked
his promise, and bids us sail back to Greece, for all
our toil is vain.  Shame and dishonour must be our
portion, now and hereafter, when our sons' sons
shall hear how we, the embattled host of Greece,
outnumbering the citizens of Troy by ten to one,
fought against them for nine long years, and then
departed, as beaten and broken men.  But such is
the will of Zeus, and none can gainsay it.  Therefore
I bid you hoist sail and away, for we are not
destined to take the town of Troy."
</p>

<p>
At these words of the King there arose a wild
commotion among his hearers, and the vast
multitude swayed to and fro like the waves of the
Ã†gÃ¦an driven this way and that by shifting gusts
of wind.  Then, as a wide field of corn bends down
before the strong breath of the west, the whole
host turned seaward, and with a mighty shout they
rushed downward to the shore, and began to launch
their ships.
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon, and those who were in his
confidence, were thunderstruck by the tremendous
effect of his speech, and stood helpless and amazed
in the midst of this scene of tumult.  The first to
recover himself was Odysseus, the wisest and the
firmest spirit among all the chieftains.  Flinging
off his mantle he went to Agamemnon, and took
from his hand the royal sceptre.  Armed with
this symbol of authority he hurried hither and
thither among the excited throng, urging each
man by threats or entreaties to return to the place
of assembly, and wait there for further instructions
from the recognised leaders of the host.
</p>

<p>
To those of rank and character he spoke
courteously, urging them to use their influence
among their followers, and check the general
flight; while with the baser sort he used rougher
means of persuasion, striking them with the sceptre
and rebuking them fiercely.  Others among the
chiefs followed his example, and at length the
tumult was stayed, and the fickle mob swept back
into the camp with a roar like the billows breaking
on a long line of rocky shore.

</p>

<p>
At length that vast audience was seated, and
waiting attentively to hear the counsels of the
King.  But one unruly knave remained standing,
and poured out a torrent of abuse against
Agamemnon and the other chiefs.  This fellow's name was
Thersites, and of all the Greeks who came up
against Troy he was the foulest, both in aspect
and in speech.  His huge misshapen head, sparsely
covered with thin, downy hair, sat awry on his
stooping shoulders.  He was bandy-legged, and
lame of one foot.  And he was the sworn enemy
of the valiant, the noble, and the wise.  This
low-born railer now began to shriek out insults in a
hideous voice against Agamemnon, his sovereign
lord.  "Son of Atreus," he bawled, "what
lackest thou yet?  Thy tents are full of gold, and
crowded with slaves, which we have won for thee
with our swords and our spears.  Lustest thou yet
after more gold, the ransom of Trojan captives?
Or dost thou want more Trojan dames to be thy
handmaids?  Up, sirs, let us be gone, lest we be
called women, and not men, if we remain here to
heap up riches for this greedy tyrant.  Have we
not seen him put public dishonour on our bravest
warrior, taking from him his lawful prize?  Surely
Achilles lacks gall to make oppression bitter,
seeing that he has suffered this bitter wrong to go
unavenged.  Were he of like mind with me, the
ruffian king would not have survived to commit
further outrages."
</p>

<p>
A stern voice here broke in upon the seditious
harangue, and Thersites perceived with alarm that
Odysseus was standing by him, staff in hand.
"Peace, saucy knave!" said the Prince of Ithaca,
in threatening tones.  "How darest thou, the very
scum and refuse of the army, to hold such language
against our exalted leader?  If I find thee uttering
thy mad folly again, may my head be smitten from
my shoulders, and may I never more be called the
father of Telemachus, if I do not strip thee naked
and drive thee forth from among the people with
blows like this."  And suiting the action to the
word he laid the heavy staff with no gentle hand
across the deformed shoulders of Thersites.  The
wretch shrank beneath the blow with a cry of pain,
and the golden staff left its print in a crimson weal
on his back.  So he sat huddled together, with
distorted face, wiping away his tears, and spoke
not another word.
</p>

<p>
Having thus silenced that loose tongue, Odysseus
mounted a platform, whence he could be seen and
heard of all the host, and lifting up his mighty
voice he began to rebuke the people for their
weakness and want of faith.  "Must I speak to
you," he said, "as to homesick women and
children, or as to veteran warriors bound by an oath
to follow their great captain for weal or for woe?
Not that I blame you overmuch, for indeed your
service has been both long and hard.  For nine
long years we have toiled in vain, and the cordage
of our ships is rotten, and their timbers are
warped.  Nevertheless, endure yet a little while,
until we have learnt whether the son of Cronos
is a true prophet or no.  Ye cannot have
forgotten the day when our ships were assembled
at Aulis, or the portents vouchsafed us there at a
solemn sacrifice to the gods.  The altar was raised
in the shadow of a goodly plane-tree, near a running
water; and in the tree was a nest of sparrows, a
mother with eight young, cheeping and cowering
beneath the leaves.  Just as we were kindling the
altar fire, a great serpent, with blood-red back,
darted up from the altar into the tree and pounced
upon the sparrows' nest.  The mother-bird fluttered
anxiously around, uttering piteous cries to see the
monster devouring her young; and the serpent,
when he had swallowed up the nestlings, caught
their mother by the wing as she hovered near, and
swallowed her also.  Then we beheld a wonder:
for the serpent, when he came down from the tree,
was turned into a stone.  And while we stood
amazed Calchas declared unto us the meaning of
that omen: "Why stand ye thus amazed, ye
warriors of Greece?  That which ye have seen is
a sign from Zeus, and this is the interpretation
thereof: the nine birds are the nine years, during
which we shall lay siege to Troy, and the serpent
is the tenth year, in which Troy shall fall!
Therefore abide steadfast, my comrades, for the nine
years are passed, and we are nearing the end of
our labours."
</p>

<p>
Odysseus ended, and a great roar of acclamation
went up from a hundred thousand throats, and
rolled like thunder along the hollow shore.  The
next speaker was Nestor, who addressed Agamemnon,
and bade him command an immediate muster
of the whole army, and lead a general attack
upon the Trojans.  "Let the people," said he,
"be ordered according to their several tribes and
clans, that thou mayest distinguish the
faint-hearted from the loyal and valiant.  Thus shall
thou learn, if disaster befalleth thee, to whom it
is due&mdash;whether to adverse heaven, or to the
cowardice and weakness of thine allies."
</p>

<p>
"Thou speakest ever to the purpose," answered
Agamemnon; "and would that I had ten such
counsellers as thee!  Then would Priam's royal city
soon bow her head, sunk in the dust beneath our
victorious hands.  But the son of Cronos hath sown
division among us, and put enmity between me and
my bravest champion.  But to our task: let the
people now get their morning meal, and then
prepare for battle.  Let every man whet his spear, and
look to the fastenings of his shield; let every steed
be fed, and every chariot set in order, that we may
fight all day till the going down of the sun.  There
shall be no rest or respite till darkness puts an end
to the fray.  Many a shield strap shall drip with
sweat, and many a hand ache with holding the
spear, and the steeds shall droop with weariness, ere
the day be done.  And if I find any man skulking
among the ships, I will give his flesh to feed the
dogs and vultures."
</p>

<p>
Then the people arose and scattered among their
tents, and soon the smoke of a thousand fires went
eddying up into the still morning air.  And every
warrior lifted up his heart in prayer to heaven, that
he might return safe and sound from the great
perils which lay before him.
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon slaughtered an ox five years old, and
summoned the noblest of the chiefs, among whom
were Nestor, Idomeneus, the two princes named
Ajax, Diomede, and Odysseus, to take their meal
with him.  In those days every meal was a sacrifice,
and this was the manner in which it was performed:
the company stood round the ox, holding in their
hands a portion of barleymeal.  Then the giver of
the feast addressed a prayer to Zeus, the meal was
sprinkled between the horns of the victim, and
after that the beast was slaughtered and flayed.
Portions of the meat were then cut off from the
carcass, wrapped in a double layer of fat, and burnt
as an offering to the gods.  When all religious rites
had been duly paid, the choicer parts of the meat
were broiled in thin slices over the fire, and eaten
with wheat or barley bread.  The flesh of beeves
and swine, or less commonly of sheep and goats,
with bread and wine, formed almost the sole diet of
the Homeric heroes.
</p>

<p>
When they had finished a copious repast, Nestor,
who, despite his eighty years, was as keen and alert
as the youngest soldier, sprang from his seat, and
cried: "To arms, comrades, to arms!  Agamemnon,
bid the heralds summon the host to the field."
</p>

<p>
The King gave the order required, and forthwith
the heralds, who were chosen for the power and
reach of their voices, went about in the camp, and
called the people to arms.  Then every captain
called his company together, and led them to the
place appointed for the general array.  And by
degrees a strange fire spread from rank to rank,
kindling in every breast a fierce longing for battle.
All softer emotions, all homesick longings, were
forgotten; for a mysterious influence was at work,
due to the unseen presence of Athene, who was
there with her wondrous, immortal shield, with its
fringe of golden tassels.  None beheld her, but all
felt her power, and the boldest grew bolder, and
the weakest were inspired with a valour not their own.
</p>

<p>
Like a fire blazing among the thickets high up
on a mountainside, so blazed the sunlight on shield
and helmet, as those countless thousands poured
forth into the plain of Scamander, and the earth
shook beneath the tramp of steeds and men.  On
and still on streamed the tide of warriors,
unnumbered as the leaves in spring, or as flies that
buzz round the milkpails on a sunny day, when the
goats are milked by a hundred hands.
</p>

<p>
And as the shepherd numbers his sheep, for he
knoweth them every one, so moved the captains
with mastery, each among his own people, and
marshalled them in their ranks.  Conspicuous
among all was seen the majestic form of Agamemnon,
to whom it seemed that every god had on that day
bestowed some peculiar grace, to make him the
observed of all observers, and give the world
assurance of a king.
</p>

<p>
But what tongue can count the myriads brought
together by the word of power on Scamander's
plain, or what memory can hold the names of the
nations assembled there?  All the chivalry of
Greece had obeyed the summons of the monarch,
sent forth nine years before, and they had come
flocking in their thousands from the broad plains of
Thessaly; from the mountain dells of Locris and of
Phocis; from the fat fields of B&oelig;otia; from Attica,
with her thin soil and bright, pellucid air; from
Salamis, the mother of heroes; from storied Argos
and renowned Sparta; from the western islands,
and from Creta, the cradle of gods.  It would
be a weary task to tell over all the heroic titles
in that muster-roll of fame, but a few must be
mentioned, as being the prime in valour and in worth.
</p>

<p>
From Locris came the lesser Ajax, son of
Oileus.  He was small of stature, but swift of foot,
and the most skilful spearsman among all the
Greeks.  His greater namesake, Ajax, son of
Telamon, and cousin to Achilles, came from
Salamis; he was a giant in stature and in strength,
and, next to Achilles, the greatest warrior in all
the host.
</p>

<p>
The ancient city of Tiryns in Argos, with its
massy walls, built by a mighty race in the very
dawn of time, sent forth a goodly company in eighty
ships; and these were commanded by Diomede,
son of Tydeus, a gallant and youthful prince,
whose deeds fill many a page in the tale of Troy
divine.  And from the neighbouring city of
MycenÃ¦, the royal seat of the line of Pelops, came
Agamemnon himself, at whose imperial nod whole
nations flew to arms.  His brother, Menelaus, the
husband of Helen, on whose account the war
had arisen, brought sixty ships, manned by the
warriors of Sparta, of which city he was king.
He was a mild and gentle prince, and a zealous
leader, though in valour and prowess not of the
first rank.
</p>

<p>
Ninety ships formed the contingent led by Nestor,
the aged King of Pylos, the most venerable figure,
and the wisest head, among all those who fought
in the cause of Helen.
</p>

<p>
Of those who came from the islands the most
famous were Odysseus, King of Ithaca, the hero of
another famous story, mighty in word and in deed,
and, after Nestor, the sagest counsellor in the
Grecian camp; and Idomeneus of Crete, a
grey-haired veteran who had proved his valour on many
a hard-fought field.
</p>

<p><a id="p24"></a></p>

<p>
Among others singled out for special mention
are Nireus, renowned for his wonderful beauty, but
otherwise a weakling; Philoctetes, now living in
lonely exile on the island of Lemnos, where he had
been left by the Greeks on account of a dreadful
wound, which rendered his presence in the camp
unbearable, and Protesilaus, who had been the first
to leap on to the Trojan shore, and had been struck
down by a Trojan in the very act.
</p>

<p>
These two were missing in the grand review of
the forces which was now held in anticipation of a
victorious march upon Troy, and their places were
supplied by others.  But there was one whose place
none could fill, and whose absence was soon to
make itself felt in dire and deadly fashion.  Achilles
sat idle in his tent, brooding over the insult which
he had received two weeks before.  His ponderous
spear, which none but he could wield, was resting
from slaughter, and his squires were polishing the
armour which he was not to wear that day.  He
started when he heard the great shout of the
Greeks, as the word was given to march, and his
heart burned with longing for battle; but
remembering his wrongs, he sank back in his seat,
frowning darkly, and muttered the single word
"Revenge!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
Greeks and Trojans face to face: The Duel
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Priam was sitting in council with all his
elders before the doors of his palace, when
a messenger rushed breathless up with the
tidings that the Greeks were marching in full force
against the city.  Instantly the meeting broke up,
and the Trojan leaders, with Hector at their head,
set out with the whole body of native warriors and
their allies to bar the way of the invader.
</p>

<p>
Halting before a solitary mound, the tomb of the
Amazon Myrine, within sight of the walls of Troy,
they drew up their forces in order of battle.  The
native Trojans, who fought under Hector, son of Priam,
formed the flower of the army; but in numbers they
were far exceeded by the troops which had assembled,
at the call of Priam, from the adjacent provinces
and coastlands of western Asia&mdash;from Lydia, Mysia,
Paphlagonia, and far-off Lycia&mdash;from Sestos and
Abydos and Thrace.  After Hector, the most famous
leaders were Ã†neas, son of Anchises and Aphrodite;
Pandarus, unrivalled for his skill in archery; Paris,
whose crime had brought all these woes on his country,
and above all the two captains of the Lycians&mdash;Sarpedon,
the son of Zeus, and Glaucus, the most knightly
figure among all the heroes of Greece and Troy.
</p>

<p>
When the various members of that motley host
had taken their appointed stations, the defenders of
Troy advanced with clamour and with tumult, like
flocks of cranes winging their way to the shores of
the ocean stream to make war on the Pygmies.
Presently the van of the Greeks came in sight, moving
on in silence, like men with one mind and one heart.
</p>

<p>
Foremost among the Trojan champions was seen
the gay and beautiful Paris.  He was clad in a
panther's skin, over which hung his bow and arrows,
and besides these weapons, in the use of which he
excelled, he was armed with two long spears and a sword.
Menelaus marked him as he came on with long strides,
and rejoiced in spirit, like a hungry lion when he catches
sight of his prey; and leaping down from his car he
advanced with uplifted spear to take vengeance on his
treacherous foe.  But when Paris saw him coming his
guilty heart quailed within him, and he shrank back
among the ranks of his comrades, like one who has
trodden on a snake while walking in a mountain glen.
</p>

<p>
"Now curse on thy fair, false face!" cried Hector
to his cowardly brother, "thou carpet-knight, thou
foul deceiver!  Better for thee to have died
childless and unwed than thus to bring shame on thy
father and all thy kinsfolk and people.  Thou art a
fit foe for women, whom thou beguilest with
witchcraft of thy wit, and wicked gifts; but all thy
gifts&mdash;thy curling locks, thy smooth, white brow, thy
sweet voice, and cunning minstrelsy&mdash;avail thee
naught when thou lookest upon the face of a man.
Verily the Trojans are as dastardly as thyself, or
long ere this thou wouldst have put on a doublet of
stone[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] for all the ills that thou hast wrought."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] That is, "Wouldst have been stoned to death."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"I have deserved thy rebuke," answered Paris.
"Keen as the blade of an axe, which bites deep
into the heart of an oak, when wielded by a sinewy
arm, so is the keenness of thy spirit, and thou
knowest not fear.  Nevertheless, mock me not for
the lovely gifts of Aphrodite, for the gifts of heaven
are not to be despised.  And if thou desirest me to
take up this quarrel with Menelaus thou hast thy
wish.  I will fight against him hand to hand, and
he who is victor shall be lord of Helen and all her
possessions.  So shall the long strife have an end,
and peace shall dwell again within our borders."
</p>

<p>
When Hector heard his brother's bold words he
was glad, and gave the word to make the Trojans
sit down in their ranks.  At first the Greeks did
not understand what was happening, and pressed
onward to the attack with a shower of stones and
arrows; but Agamemnon soon perceived that
Hector had something to propose, and gave the
signal for a general halt.
</p>

<p>
Then Hector, standing midway between the two
armies, made known the offer of Paris, and asked
for an armistice, that the two champions might try
the issue between them.  All eyes were now turned
on Menelaus, who responded boldly to the
challenge.  "I am well content," said he, "that this
quarrel should be decided by the hands of us twain;
for it grieves my heart that so many should suffer
for the sake of my private wrong.  Let two lambs
be brought&mdash;a white ram as an offering to the sun,
and a black ram as an offering to the earth; and go
some of you to fetch Priam, that he may preside at
the treaty.  His sons we may not trust, for they
are hot-blooded and faithless; but an old man's
head is cool, and his eye looks before and after."
</p>

<p>
Right pleased were both Greeks and Trojans
when the order was sent round to dismount from
their cars and pile their arms; for they thought
that the end of their bitter feud was near.  Two
heralds were despatched to bring down Priam from
the city, and Agamemnon sent another for a victim
to be sacrificed on behalf of the Greeks.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Helen was sitting in her chamber, weaving a fair
tapestry, on which were wrought the famous deeds
done in her cause by Greek and Trojan heroes,
when her task was interrupted by the sudden
entrance of her kinswoman, Laodice, a daughter of
Priam.  "Make haste, dear sister," said the lady,
"come with me, and see the wonderful thing which
has been brought to pass.  Greeks and Trojans are
sitting down in amity together, and Paris and
Menelaus are to fight with long spears for the mastery;
and he that prevaileth shall call thee his wife."
</p>

<p>
When she heard that, a great longing came into
the heart of Helen for her Spartan home and her
former lord.  With one tearful glance at the speaker
she rose from her seat, veiled her face, and made
her way to the high tower above the gate where
Priam was sitting with the elders of Troy.  The
shrill, piping voices[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>] of the old men struck upon her
ears as she stepped out upon the turret; and when
they saw her they put their heads together, and
whispered their admiration of her wondrous
loveliness.  "How fair, how very fair she is!" murmured
one white-bearded veteran.  "Is she not worthy to
be the arbitress of life and death to a whole
generation of heroes!  Nevertheless let her depart, and
breed no further mischief to us and our children."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then Priam called to her, and beckoned her with
a courteous gesture to take her place by his side.
"Come hither, dear daughter," he said, "where
thou canst see thy former husband, and thy kinsfolk
and friends.  I blame thee not at all because of this
war which the gods have brought upon me in mine
old age.  Now tell me," he continued, pointing with
his finger towards the Greek army, which lay in full
view upon the plain, "who is that stately man to
whom all the other chieftains seem to pay homage?
Ne'er saw I one of so kingly a mien."
</p>

<p>
"I dread thy presence, father," answered Helen,
glancing in the direction indicated, and then casting
down her eyes.  "I tremble before thee, kind as
thou art, for I feel all the wrong which I have done
unto thee and thine.  And as touching him of whom
thou askest, that is Agamemnon, son of Atreus, lord
of a wide empire, a righteous king, and a valiant
warrior.  Once I called him brother," she added,
with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis then as I thought," rejoined Priam, "for
there is sovereignty in his look.  And who is he
who stands next to Agamemnon, in stature less than
he, but broader of shoulder and deeper of chest?
Methinks he is like a stately ram, who stalks
majestic before the flock as they go to pasture."
</p>

<p>
"That is Odysseus, son of Laertes," answered
Helen, "bred in the rugged isle of Ithaca.  All Greece
cannot show his equal in wisdom and eloquence."
</p>

<p>
"Lady," said Antenor, an elder of high rank.
"herein thou hast spoken the very truth.  I
entertained him of whom thou speakest as my guest
when he came hither on an embassy with Menelaus,
and I heard them both speaking before the assembly
of the Trojans.  When they stood up together
Menelaus was by far the taller; but when they
were seated there was greater dignity in Odysseus.
Then as to eloquence, Odysseus bore away the palm
from all&mdash;though Menelaus spoke both fluently and
to the purpose.  At first, when Odysseus rose to
speak, we wondered to see how ungracefully he
stood, leaning heavily on his sceptre, with eyes
fixed upon the ground.  He seemed a very churl,
unskilled in all courtesy and the arts of civil life.
But when he lifted up his mighty voice, and his words
floated about us like the snowflakes of winter, we
knew that we were listening to a divinely gifted man."
</p>

<p>
At Priam's request Helen named the other
chieftains of the Greeks, Ajax and Idomeneus,
and the rest; and when the recital was ended she
remained gazing wistfully at the dense masses of
fighting men who sat waiting on the plain.  "I
cannot see them," she murmured sadly: "they are
not there."  "Of whom speakest thou?" asked
Priam.  "Of Castor and Polydeuces," she answered,
"the bold rider, and the stout boxer, my own
brothers, born of the same mother with me.
Perchance they sailed not in the fleet to Troy, or
perchance they have remained behind in the camp,
in sorrow for their sister's shame."

<p>
Ah!  Helen, thy brothers are lying where shame
and sorrow can reach them no more, sleeping in
their quiet graves, in LacedÃ¦mon, their native land.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
While Priam was still conversing with Helen, a
herald entered with the startling news that his
presence was required in the field, to settle the
conditions of the single combat between Paris and
Menelaus.  Some natural pangs he felt, when he
heard of the danger which threatened his son.
Nevertheless he set out at once, taking with him
the victims required for the sacrifice.  When he
came to the open space between the two armies
he found all things ready for the solemn rite.  The
chiefs stood waiting in a circle, and in their midst
was Agamemnon, who acted as priest.  The heralds
mingled two portions of pure[<a id="chap03fn3text"></a><a href="#chap03fn3">3</a>] wine in a bowl, and
poured water over the hands of the chieftains.
Then Agamemnon drew a sharp knife, which hung
at his girdle by his ponderous sword, and cutting
off a few hairs from the foreheads of the victims
gave them to the heralds to distribute among the
princes.  When this was done, amidst a general
hush he uttered this solemn prayer: "Father Zeus,
Lord of Ida, most glorious, most mighty, ye rivers,
and thou earth, and ye dread powers beneath, who
take vengeance after death on all those who swear
a false oath, be ye all the witnesses and guardians
of our treaty.  If Paris slays Menelaus he shall
keep Helen for his wife, with all her goods; but
should Paris fall Helen shall go back to Menelaus,
her lawful lord.  Let the war be decided by the
issue of this combat, and Heaven defend the
right!"  Therewith he cut the throats of the victims, and
laid their quivering bodies on the ground.  Then
the drink-offering was poured, with this awful
imprecation on those who should break the treaty:
"If any man violate our sworn oath, may his brains
be poured out, even as this wine, and may his wife
and children be sold into bondage."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap03fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn3text">3</a>] In sacrifices pure wine was used; wine for drinking
was always mixed with water.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Priam now took his departure from the field, for
he could not bear to see his son in deadly combat
with Menelaus.  When he was gone, Hector and
Odysseus measured out the ground for the duel,
and shook the lots in a helmet, to see who should
be the first to cast his spear; and the lot fell on Paris.
Meanwhile Paris was putting on his armour; for he
had come lightly equipped as an archer into the field.
</p>

<p>
The two rivals took their stand on either side,
clad in their brazen harness, and armed with sword
and spear.  And first Paris cast his spear, which
struck upon the shield of Menelaus, and did him no
harm.  Then Menelaus lifted up his spear, and
murmured a prayer to Zeus: "Grant me, O King, to
take vengeance on him who brought dishonour on
my home, where he dwelt as my honoured guest."  As
he spoke, he flung his good ashen spear, which
clove its way through the shield of Paris, and tore
his tunic close to his side; but Paris swerved aside
and escaped a wound.  Before he could recover
himself Menelaus was upon him, sword in hand,
and struck him with all his force upon the helmet;
but once more fortune favoured the Trojan, for the
blade was shivered on the ridge of the helmet, and
Menelaus grasped a useless hilt.  "Curse on thee,
treacherous steel!" cried he, and, seizing Paris by
the helmet, began to drag him towards the ranks
of the Greeks.  This time he would have succeeded,
and taken his enemy captive, had not the strap
which held the helmet given way under the strain,
so that the brazen headpiece came away empty in
his hand.
</p>

<p>
Menelaus flung the helmet towards his friends,
and picking up his spear turned again upon his
cowardly foe, with purpose to slay him.  But Paris
was nowhere to be seen: an invisible hand had
caught him up, and carried him away from the
righteous hand of the avenger.  For Aphrodite,
the soft goddess of love, had been hovering near to
protect her favourite.  She it was who had caused
the helmet strap to break, and now she saved him
a second time, and bore him swiftly to his house
in Troy.  There he was presently visited by the
lovely Helen, who, though she scorned him in her
heart, was drawn thither by a fatal spell which she
could not resist; and in the sunshine of her smiles
he soon forgot dishonour and defeat.
</p>

<p>
All this time Menelaus was raging about the
field, like a tiger robbed of his prey, and calling
upon the Trojans to surrender the recreant to his
vengeance; and they would gladly have done so,
if they had known where to find him, for they
hated him worse than death.  And Agamemnon,
amid general applause, demanded the surrender of
Helen, according to the terms of the treaty.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
The Breaking of the Truce
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The gods were met in full assembly in their
golden palace, pledging one another in full
cups of nectar, and looking down upon the
great drama which was being enacted on the plains
of Troy.  Then Zeus began to speak, casting a
sly glance at his fair consort, Hera: "Menelaus
has two stout backers among the gods, Hera,
Queen of Argos, and Athene, strong to defend.
But they seem to have renounced his cause, for
they have suffered Aphrodite to steal away Paris
when death stared him in the face.  'Tis well, then,
Menelaus has the victory, and naught remains
but to give back Helen, and put an end to the war."
</p>

<p>
At this most unwelcome proposal Athene frowned
angrily at her father, but said nothing; Hera,
however, could not contain her wrath, and raised her
voice in indignant protest: "Out upon thee, son
of Cronos, what a word hast thou spoken!  Is this
to be the end of all my toil and my sweat, when
I travelled without ceasing, until my steeds were
well-nigh foundered, to gather this host against
Troy?  Do as thou wilt; but know this, that, if
thou doest this thing, not one of us shall praise
thee, no, not one."
</p>

<p>
"What strange passion possesses thee?"
answered Zeus, in tones of displeasure, "Why
harbourest thou this deadly rancour against Priam
and the sons of Priam?  Methinks thou couldst
find it in thy heart to go down into the city, and
feast on the raw flesh of the men of Troy, until
thou hadst devoured them all.  Howbeit, let there
be peace among us; I give thee leave to work
thy will upon this king and his people; only
remember that I have yielded to thee in this,
and when I am minded to destroy some city
which is dear to thee stand not thou in my way.
For I love the towers of holy Ilios, and they that
dwell therein, for they have paid me faithful
worship, with meat-offering and with drink-offering,
with reverence and with prayer."
</p>

<p>
"Take Argos," replied the impetuous Hera.
"Take Sparta or MycenÃ¦, the three choicest
jewels in my crown; burn, waste, and destroy
them, if such be thy pleasure.  Only grant me
this boon, and let me wreak my fury upon Troy.
If thou consentest to this, lay thy command upon
thy daughter, Athene, that she may go down among
the Greeks and Trojans, and make an end of this
detested truce."
</p>

<p>
Zeus nodded in token of approval, and Athene,
who was only waiting for the signal, shot down
from Olympus like a falling star, and alighted in
the space between the two armies.  Arrived there,
she put on the form of Laodocus, a noble Trojan
youth, and went in search of Pandarus, a famous
bowman, and a favourite of the archer-god Apollo.
And when she had found him, she spake unto him
in this wise: "Bold son of Lycaon, art thou man
enough to do a great deed, and win praise and
reward from all the Trojans, but especially from
Paris?  If thou art, take thine arrows and thy
bow, and aim a shaft at Menelaus, having first
vowed a vow to Apollo that when thou returnest
to thy home among the rich pastures of Ida, thou
wilt offer him a sacrifice of lambs, the firstlings of
the flock."
</p>

<p>
So spake Athene, tempting him; and he hearkened
unto her in his folly, and began to take the
cover from his bow.  It was a powerful weapon,
formed from the horns of a great ibex, which he
himself had brought down by a skilful shot long
ago.  The horns, each sixteen palms in length,
were set firmly in a solid bridge, and tipped at
each end with gold.  Resting the lower end of the
bow against his foot, he leaned upon it, and strung
it, and laying it down took off the lid of his quiver,
and selected an arrow.  Then he took up the bow
again, and set the arrow on the string.  His
companions, who had been covering him with their
shields while he was making his preparations, now
stepped aside, and he, having made his vow to
Apollo, lifted up his bow, drew the arrow to his
ear, and shot.  The bow twanged loud and clear, and
the arrow leapt hissing towards the Grecian ranks.
</p>

<p>
Then ill had it fared with thee, Menelaus, had
not Athene been standing at thy side, to guard
thee from fatal hurt.  And as a mother brushes
a fly from the face of her babe, lying in sweet
slumber on her lap, so Athene suffered not the
arrow to reach any vital part, but guided it to
the place where the plates of his corslet met at
his side.  Through the girdle pierced the shaft,
through the brazen corslet, and through the
taslet which covered his loins; the point just grazed
the surface of his flesh, and the red blood began
to flow, staining his thighs, and trickling down to
his ankles.
</p>

<p>
When Agamemnon saw his brother wounded
and bleeding, he ran to his side, and taking him by
the hand began to deplore the evil issue of their
treaty.  "Must thy life pay the forfeit for the
perjured men of Troy, who have trampled our covenant
underfoot?  I know indeed that vengeance will
overtake them in the end from the hands of Zeus,
whose name they have taken in vain; yea, well
I know that the day shall come when holy Ilios
shall fall, involved with all her people in one
common doom.  But what will that avail, if I lose
thee, my brother?  My army will desert me, for
they cannot fight without a cause, and thou art the
cause which brought them hither.  Troy's doom
will be wrought by other hands, and I shall go
back to Argos, a beaten man, leaving thy bones
to rot in a foreign grave."
</p>

<p>
"Speak not so loud," said Menelaus, when
Agamemnon paused at last; "thou wilt cause a
panic in the army.  There is no ground for alarm;
the wound is not deep.  Send for Machaon, the
skilled leech, that he may draw out the arrow, and
stanch the flow of blood."
</p>

<p>
Then Agamemnon was comforted, and sent
Talthybius the herald to bring the leech, who was
a son of Asclepius, the most famous physician of
those times.  After some delay, Machaon came
to the place where Menelaus was standing, leaning
on his brother's arm, and surrounded by an anxious
group of his friends.  With firm but gentle hand
the leech drew out the arrow, and, removing the
prince's armour, exposed the wound to view.  Then
he applied healing herbs, and bade the patient be
of good cheer, for his hurt was but slight.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
The truce having been broken by the treacherous
act of Pandarus, both sides prepared for an
immediate assault.  Agamemnon, as soon as he
was assured that his brother was in no danger,
summoned his chariot, and, bidding the driver keep
within call, went on foot up and down the ranks
of the Greeks, encouraging those whom he saw
pressing forward to the attack with promises of
favour and reward, and upbraiding those who hung
back with taunts and rebukes.  His heart rejoiced
when he saw the towering form of Ajax, who was
hurrying to battle, followed close by a stout troop
of spearsmen, with shield pressing on shield, and
bristling spears.  Near him was Idomeneus, the
grizzled captain of the Cretans, with his comrade,
Meriones, at the head of a numerous and
well-appointed troop.  And after these he came to
the men of Nestor, who were receiving instructions
from their veteran leader how to bear themselves
in the battle.  "Keep your ranks," he was
saying, "and fight shoulder to shoulder, the
horsemen in the van, and the infantry ready to support
them behind.  And let no one be carried away
by his zeal to engage singlehanded with the
enemy, for union is strength, and weakness comes
of division."
</p>

<p>
These were the foremost, but there were others,
and among them some of the most valiant leaders
in the army, whose station was more remote, and
who had not yet heard of the breaking of the truce.
One of these was Diomede, and when Agamemnon
found him standing inactive, he rebuked him harshly,
reminding him of his father's prowess, and calling
him an unworthy son.  The young chieftain deigned
no answer to the unmerited reproach, but at once
put his men in motion to join the encounter.
</p>

<p>
The whole army was now advancing, rank pressing
on rank, and column on column, like the waves
rushing landward along a wide-watered shore.  The
Greeks came on in silence, broken only by the
short, sharp words of command; but the Trojans,
whose army was made up of a motley throng of
many nations, rushed to the onset with multitudinous
cries, like ewes at milking-time in the folds
of a wealthy sheep master, when they hear the
voices of their lambs.  On the Trojan side was
Ares, and on the side of the Greeks stern-eyed
Athene, with whom were seen Panic and Flight,
and insatiable Strife, who is small of stature at the
beginning of a fray, but grows and grows as the
feud proceeds, until her head presses against the
sky as she stalks along the earth.
</p>

<p>
Then the air was rent with a deafening crash,
as the two armies met, and shield was dashed
against shield, and brazen armour was dinted by
spear and axe and sword.  Shouts of triumph
arose, and cries of anguish, as the wild <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>
swayed to and fro, and the ground ran with blood.
As two torrents descending from copious springs
high up in the mountains, and swollen high by
winter rains, mingle their waters with a roar at a
place where two glens meet&mdash;such was the roar
which went up to heaven, at the conflict of those
mailed hosts.
</p>

<p>
Among the many victims of that bloody day,
some are singled out for especial mention.  One
of these was Simocisius, a tall and comely youth,
so named because he was born on the banks of the
Simocis, when his mother went to visit her parents
on their farm.  Ajax marked him as he came on,
and smote him in the breast with his spear; and
down he fell, like a tall poplar, which rears its
stately height in a meadow by the riverside, until
it is hewn down by a wheelwright to make a felly
for a chariot; and there it lies seasoning on the
banks of the stream.  So lay the young Simocisius,
and Ajax stripped him of his armour.  While he
was thus engaged, Antiphus, a son of Priam, flung
a javelin at him, but, missing him, struck down
Leucus, a comrade of Odysseus, who had laid hold
of the corpse to hale it away.  Odysseus was
exceeding wroth at the fall of his comrade, and
stepping forward he flung his spear, and smote
Democoon, a natural son of Priam, in the temple.
The Trojan champions fell back before him, and
the Greeks rushed forward and gained possession
of the dead.  Apollo, who sat watching the battle
from the citadel of Troy, was indignant when he
saw the Trojans give ground, and shouted to them
in a loud voice, crying: "Up, ye horsemen of
Troy, and fly not from these Greeks, for their
flesh is not of stone or of iron, to resist the thrust
of your spears.  Now is your time, while Achilles
is absent, chewing the cud of his ire among
the ships."
</p>

<p>
The Trojans rallied at the cry of the god, and
the battle was resumed with fresh fury on both
sides.  It was no child's play, no holiday tilting,
which was seen that morning on the Trojan plain,
but the dire and dreadful game of war, with Ares
and Athene for players, and the blood of heroes for
the stakes.

<h3>
The Exploits of Diomede
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Agamemnon's taunts had sunk deep into
the heart of Diomede, and he went into
battle with a stern resolve to vindicate his
manhood in the eyes of all Greece.  A fierce light
blazed from his helm and shield as he rushed, like a
living engine of destruction, into the thickest of the
fight.  The first to feel the weight of his arm was a
young Trojan named Phegeus, son of Dares, a priest
of HephÃ¦stus.  Mounted on the same car with his
brother IdÃ¦us, he drove furiously at Diomede, who
was fighting on foot, and aimed a blow at him with
his spear; but the weapon went wide of the mark,
and the next moment he rolled from his car, pierced
through the breast by the spear of Diomede.
IdÃ¦us sprang to the ground and fled, leaving car
and horses as a spoil to his brother's slayer.
</p>

<p>
While Diomede was disposing of his booty, the
Greeks pursued their advantage, and there was not
a chieftain of name among them who failed to slay
his man.  Then fell Scamandrius, a famous Trojan
hunter, and the favourite of Artemis, pierced in the
back by the spear of Menelaus, and Phericlus, whose
father, Tecton, had built the fatal ships which bore
Paris and his retinue to Greece, and many more,
of whose names there is no record.
</p>

<p>
Back to the field came Diomede, sweeping all
before him like a river in flood, which breaks down
dyke and dam, and covers the smiling fields with ruin.
So impetuous were his movements as he darted to
and fro in pursuit of the flying Trojans, that it was
hard to see on which side he fought; but, wherever
he passed, his path was strewn with Trojan dead.
</p>

<p>
At last he received a check from Pandarus, the
archer whose treacherous hand had broken the
truce an hour or two before.  Watching him from
a safe distance, Pandarus shot an arrow, which
pierced clean through Diomede's right shoulder,
staining his corslet with blood.  Loud was the joy
of Pandarus when he saw the success of his
archery: "Turn again," he shouted, "ye horsemen
of Troy!  Back to the fray, every one!  The
bravest of the Greeks is wounded unto death."
</p>

<p>
The boast of Pandarus was premature, for the
wound was not severe, though sufficient to disable
the hero's arm for the moment.  Diomede drew
back out of the press, and with the assistance of
Sthenelus, his charioteer, drew out the arrow which
was galling his shoulder.  Then he stood apart
and prayed to Athene, the patron goddess of his
mighty father, Tydeus.  And she heard him, and
came and stood before him in all her divine majesty,
and said: "Take heart, son of Tydeus, for I am
ever near thee, and I have put into thy heart all
the valour of thy sire.  And I have taken from
thine eyes the darkness which before lay upon
them, that thou mayest look upon the gods and
know them, face to face.[<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]  If thou seest any of the
other gods, avoid them, and presume not to fight
against the children of heaven; but if Aphrodite,
Jove's froward daughter, comes into the battle, have
at her, and strike, and fear nothing."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn1text">1</a>] Compare "Stories from the Ã†neid," p. 18.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Athene vanished as she spoke, but Diomede felt
her influence working powerfully within him, and
in an instant the flow of his blood was stanched,
and he felt no more pain from his wound.  Then
like a lion who has been grazed by the shepherd's
spear as he leaps into a lonely sheepfold, and is but
provoked to new rage by that slight wound, so that
he falls upon the helpless flock, and gluts himself
with carnage, while the shepherd cowers away in
terror&mdash;so Diomede returned with new fury to the
slaughter, and drove the Trojans in rout before him.
Like hammer on anvil, so rained his strokes
among the ranks of the foe.  With one blow he
sent his spear through the breast of a tall Trojan;
with the next his keen falchion shore oft the arm
and shoulder of another.  Leaving these where they
lay, he went in pursuit of Abas and Polyidus, the
sons of Eurydamas, a famous seer and interpreter
of dreams.  Often had they listened to their father's
lore, and brought their dreams to him to expound
unto them.  But the worst dream they ever had
now came upon them; and when they awoke they
were on the banks of the Styx.  Yet another
Trojan father had cause to mourn that
day&mdash;PhÃ¦nops, a man of wealth, who sent two sons, the
children of his old age, to the war.  But never
again did his aged eyes brighten to behold the face
of his children, and all his wealth was divided
among strangers.
</p>

<p>
When Ã†neas observed the havoc which was
wrought by the arm of Diomede he went to
Pandarus, and said to him: "Where is thy boasted
skill in archery, that thou sufferest this man to hew
down our ranks, and never liftest thy bow against
him?  Come, shoot me an arrow at the breast of
Diomede, and first utter a prayer to Zeus, that we
may know if the gods are indeed against us."
</p>

<p>
"If that be Diomede," answered Pandarus,
"there is something divine in this frenzy of his;
methinks he is some god, who has put on the
likeness of Diomede.  But now, I aimed an arrow
at him, and struck him fairly in the right shoulder.
I thought that he was already a passenger to
Hades, but, lo! he comes forth stronger and more
terrible than before.  In an evil hour I took my
bow from the wall, when I came to fight on the
side of Priam; and I hearkened not to my father's
words when he bade me fight like the rest with
chariot and with horses, whereof he had goodly
store.  Twice have I drawn my bow this day
against the noblest of the Greeks, Menelaus, and
Diomede, and struck them fair, and made their
blood to flow; but it hath naught availed.  If ever
I get safely home again, I will offer my head to be
severed from my shoulders by the meanest churl, if
I do not break this accursed bow of mine in pieces,
and burn it with fire."
</p>

<p>
"This is idle talk," answered Ã†neas.  "We
must meet this man face to face and hand to hand
if we would stay his fury.  Come, mount my car
with me, that thou mayest see of what mettle are
these steeds of mine, unrivalled in flight or in
pursuit.  If thou wilt, take the reins, and I will
stand by thy side to wield the spear; or if thou
preferrest it, I will drive and thou shalt fight."
</p>

<p>
"Drive thou," replied Pandarus, mounting by
the side of Ã†neas, "so that if there be need of
hasty flight, the steeds may not fail us, knowing their
master's hand."  "Thou sayest well," said Ã†neas,
and, lashing the horses to a gallop, drove rapidly
towards the place where Diomede was fighting.
</p>

<p>
"Back, Diomede!" shouted Sthenelus, in alarm,
when he saw them approaching.  "I see two
mighty men coming against us&mdash;Pandarus, son of
Lycaon, and Ã†neas, whose mother is the goddess
Aphrodite.  Mount the car, and let us retreat."
</p>

<p>
"How darest thou name retreat to me," answered
Diomede sternly, "I scorn thy counsels, and will
go to meet these champions even as I am, on foot;
both of them shall not return alive.  And now
mark my words, and do as I shall bid thee: if these
twain fall beneath my spear, leave thou the horses
which thou art driving, and, having mounted the car
of Ã†neas, drive with all speed to the rear.  For
these steeds are of blood divine, descended from
those which Zeus gave unto Tros as a recompense
for the loss of Ganymede his son.  If we can capture
them it will be a splendid prize."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he turned to meet the Trojan chieftains,
who were now close at hand.  Pandarus held his
weapon ready poised, and when he came within
throwing distance he cast his lance, crying: "Take
that, bold son of Tydeus!  Perchance I shall have
better luck with the spear."  The weighty spear,
thrown by no feeble hand, pierced through the shield
of Diomede, and struck against his breastplate,
but there stopped short, without inflicting a wound.
"Thou hast no luck to-day, Sir Pandarus," said
Diomede, smiling grimly.  "Now see how thou
likest the taste of Grecian steel," and as he spoke
he hurled with all his force, right in the face of
Pandarus.  The keen point struck him just beneath
the eye, and passing downwards clove through his
tongue at the root, and came out under his chin;
and the false Trojan fell with a crash on the plain,
and died as he fell.
</p>

<p>
Ã†neas had now but one thought&mdash;to save his
comrade's body from outrage at the hands of the
Greeks; for it was the cruel custom of those days
to mutilate the bodies of slaughtered enemies.
Valiantly he took his stand, bestriding the fallen
Pandarus, holding his shield before him, and armed
with two spears.  But Diomede picked up a huge
stone, and flung it at Ã†neas; and the jagged
missile struck him on the hip, just at the socket of
the thigh, bruising the sinews and lacerating the
flesh.  Ã†neas sank down on one knee, sick and
giddy with the pain of that dreadful blow; and that
would have been his last hour had not his goddess
mother perceived his evil plight, and come to her
son's relief.  Swiftly she flew to the place where he
lay, and, throwing her white arms about him, bore
him from the field, covered by the folds of her robe.
</p>

<p>
Sthenelus had not forgotten his friend's command,
and as soon as he saw the car of Ã†neas deserted
he made fast the reins of his own steeds to the chariot
rim, and mounting the Trojan car drove at a gallop
towards the rear.  Meeting a comrade he gave the
captured chariot into his charge, and returned with
all speed to the support of Diomede, who was in
hot pursuit of the tender goddess and her wounded
son.  Presently he caught her in the midst of the
press, and, thrusting with his spear, wounded her
on the hand, in the thick part of the thumb.  The
ichor[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>] flowed forth in a purple stream, and stained
her immortal vestments, wrought for her by the
Graces; and with a loud shriek she let fall her son,
who was picked up and borne to a place of safety
by Apollo.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn2text">2</a>] The blood of the gods was so called.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Hast thou had enough of war, daughter of
Zeus?" shouted Diomede as she fled; "go and
make war on cowardly women&mdash;they are thy
proper prey."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
The beautiful, tender goddess of love, who was
a stranger to wounds and pain, was found by
Iris wandering about the battlefield in a distracted
state, with livid face and shaking limbs.  Iris took
her by the hand, and brought her to the place where
Ares was sitting, outside the roar and tumult of
battle.  When she saw her brother, Aphrodite fell
on her knees before him, and begged him to lend
her his car, and Ares having readily consented, she
mounted the golden chariot with Iris, and was
driven through the air till she came to Olympus.
There she sought her mother Dione, who received
her with sweet words of comfort, and asked who had
handled her so roughly?  "It was that unmannerly
Greek, the son of Tydeus," answered Aphrodite
pettishly, "for the Greeks have left off butchering
the Trojans, and are making war on the gods."
</p>

<p>
"Take heart, my child," said Dione, "and be
not overmuch dismayed, for many of us, the children
of heaven, have suffered at the hands of mortals,
for whose sake we afflict one another.  Ares was
bound and held captive by the giant sons of Aloeus,
and would have perished in his bonds, had not
Hermes stolen him away.  Hera was wounded in
the breast with an arrow by Hercules; and Hades
came groaning to Olympus, hurt in the shoulder
by the same presumptuous hand.  And thou hast
suffered through the spite of Athene, who set on
the son of Tydeus to assail thee.  Rash fool!  He
knows not that he who fights with gods is doomed
to an early grave.  Let him take heed lest the
young wife whom he left at home in Argos be made
a widow untimely, and rouse her household at dead
of night, weeping and wailing for her fallen lord."
</p>

<p>
Then she laid a healing finger on her daughter's
wound, and the hand was made whole, and the bitter
pangs were stilled.  Athene had been watching the
scene, and now she said mockingly to her father:
"Be not wroth, dread sire, at what I shall say!
Surely Aphrodite hath been seeking to beguile
some Grecian dame on behalf of her darling Trojans,
and amidst her soft caresses has scratched her
slender hand on the pin of the lady's brooch."
</p>

<p>
Zeus smiled at his daughter's words, and calling
Aphrodite to him he took her in his fatherly arms
and said: "Not for thee, my child, are wars and
fightings; leave these to Ares and Athene, and
keep to thine own province of love and marriage."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
When Diomede saw his prey snatched from him
a second time he was very wroth, and followed
close on Apollo, who was bearing Ã†neas towards
the city.  Three times he sprang upon the god, and
three times Apollo hurled him back; and he was
preparing to make a fourth assault, when Apollo
rebuked him sternly, and bade him stand off.
Remembering the words of Athene, who had warned
him not to meddle with any other god save
Aphrodite, Diomede drew back, and Ã†neas was carried
in safety to the shelter of the citadel.
</p>

<p>
Apollo was highly incensed at the presumption
of Diomede, and leaving Ã†neas in good hands he
hastened back to the battlefield, and roused Ares
to take up the cause of insulted heaven, and chastise
the impious man who twice that day had pointed
his weapon against the person of a god.  Ares
readily took up the challenge, and putting on the
likeness of a Trojan he flung himself in the path
of the panic-stricken fugitives, shouting: "Where
are the sons of Priam, and why suffer they the
people to be slaughtered like sheep?"
</p>

<p>
"Hearest thou what he saith?" cried Sarpedon,
the giant leader of the Lycians, to Hector, who
had been dismayed, like the rest, by the prowess of
Diomede.  "What art thou doing, thou and thy
brethren, that ye leave the brunt of battle to be
borne by your allies?  Have we not left home and
country, our wives and our little ones, to pour out
our blood in defence of thy city?&mdash;and wilt thou not
play thy part, when honour and duty call thee&mdash;when
the very stones of thy streets cry aloud to thee
to be the first in the onset, the last to retreat?"
</p>

<p>
Stung by Sarpedon's reproaches, Hector leapt
from his car, and exerted all his authority to rally
the flying Trojans.  By his efforts the flight was
checked, and the Trojans wheeled their chariots
and returned to the charge.  The ranks of the
Greeks grew white from the clouds of dust thrown
up by their chariot wheels as they came on like a
whirlwind, with Ares in their van.  Presently, to
the equal delight and amazement of the Trojans, the
princely form of Ã†neas was seen glittering among
the foremost champions; and his step was as
light, and his arm as firm, as when the fight began.
They would have learnt, if they had asked, that
this was the work of Apollo; but they had no time
to question him, for by this time the storm of battle
was raging with redoubled fury.
</p>

<p>
Like clouds which lie heavy on the mountain-tops,
when all the winds are sleeping, so steadfast
stood the Greeks to abide the shock of that charge.
And Agamemnon strode up and down the armed
files, crying as he passed: "Stand firm, and play the
man!  Before you lies the path of honour, but
behind is shame and defeat."
</p>

<p>
Long the contest swayed to and fro with doubtful
issue, and many a Greek, and many a Trojan,
named or unnamed, received the wages of the sword.
At last Diomede, whose vision had been purged by
Athene, recognised Ares under his disguise; then
even he began to lose heart, and cried out to the
Greeks: "We must retreat!  Ares is fighting
against us.  Fall back upon the ships, keeping
your faces to the foe."  And slowly, step by step,
disputing every inch of ground, the Greeks began
to retire.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto Hera and Athene had remained inactive
spectators of the struggle: but when they
saw that the tide of battle had turned they resolved
to make a vigorous stand against the victorious
career of Ares.  With her own hand Hera
harnessed the steeds to her royal car, which was the
work of no mortal artist, with its brazen wheels
and axle of iron.  The body of the car was
cunningly wrought with bands of gold and silver; the
pole was a solid bar of silver, and the yoke was of
gold.  Meanwhile Athene was arming herself for
the conflict.  First she put on a coat of mail, not
to be pierced by any mortal weapon; on her head
she placed a helmet, glittering with symbols of
war and death; then she grasped her shield, the
immortal Ã¦gis, of "ethereal temper, massy, large,
and round," on which were pictured Panic and
Strife, Defence and Pursuit, and all the dread
powers whose realm is the battlefield; and in
the midst glared the Gorgon's head, with its
awful eyes, which freeze the blood and paralyse
the limbs.
</p>

<p>
Having asked and obtained permission of Zeus,
they mounted the car, Hera guiding the fiery
coursers of heaven, and Athene standing, spear in
hand, at her side.  In another moment they drew
up before the cloudy portals of Olympus, which are
given in charge of the mystic Daughters of Time,
to open and to shut.  Wide flew the gates, with
muttered roar, at the summons of the queen of
heaven; and forth they leapt into the void and
cavernous vault of air.  Far as a man can see into
the dim distance, when he stands on some skyey
peak and gazes across the purple sea&mdash;so wide is
the space traversed by the heavenly steeds at a
single stride.
</p>

<p>
When they came to the place where Simoeis and
Scamander mingle their waters in one stream, they
drew up their car, and dismounted, leaving the
steeds in charge of the river-god Simoeis, whose
banks put forth ambrosial herbs for them to feed
upon.  Then, walking delicately, like a pair of
doves,[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>] but with no tender thoughts in their breasts,
they went and joined the ranks of the Greeks,
where they stood at bay round Diomede, like boars
or lions hard pressed by the hunters.  Standing in
their midst, Hera took the form and the voice of
Stentor, whose shout was as the shout of fifty men.
"Shame on you, ye Greeks!" she thundered.
"As long as Achilles fought among you, the
Trojans never ventured beyond their gates; but
now they are fighting at the very confines of your
camp."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap05fn3"></a>
[<a href="#chap05fn3text">3</a>] I have preserved the language of the original,
which seems to have a touch of irony.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Diomede had drawn back from the fighting-line,
for his arm was lamed by the wound which he had
received from Pandarus, which now began to stiffen
and grow painful.  In this state he was found by
Athene, just as he was lifting up his shield strap to
wipe away the blood from his shoulder.  Laying
her hand on the yoke of his car she said: "The
son of Tydeus is most unlike his sire, who was
little of stature, but mighty of heart.  With him I
needed the curb to restrain his fiery spirit, which
prompted him to fight against any odds.  But thy
sluggish nature ever wants the goad.  Say, art
thou weary, or art thou afraid?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not fear that has made me shrink," answered
Diomede.  "I am but obeying thy behest, when thou
forbadest me to resist any god, save only
Aphrodite.  And thou seest Ares is lending aid to the
Greeks."
</p>

<p>
"Fear neither Ares, nor any other god," replied
Athene.  "Mount thou thy car with me, and thou
shalt see whether this turncoat, this fickle, furious,
bloodthirsty god of war, will brook thy onset when
I am by thy side.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon she thrust down Sthenelus from the
chariot, and taking his place beckoned to Diomede
to mount with her.  Diomede obeyed, and the
beechen axle groaned beneath the weight of the
hero and the goddess.  Athene plied the lash, and
drove straight at Ares, who was stooping to strip
off the armour of a Greek champion whom he had
just slain with his own hand.  The goddess had
put on the helmet of Hades, which made her
invisible to the eyes of Ares; and he, when he saw
Diomede coming against him, left off stripping the
corpse, and charged with levelled spear.  But
Athene caught the weapon by the shaft, and turned
the point aside.  Then Diomede thrust at Ares
with his spear, Athene aiding him, and wounded
him in the side.  And as the roar of ten thousand
men in the full fury of battle, so was the roar of
Ares when he felt that wound.
</p>

<p>
Like a heavy thundercloud, which hangs black
and threatening when heaven is overcast, and a
storm is brewing on a sultry day, such appeared the
giant form of Ares as he fled darkling across the
sky to Olympus; and when he reached the seat of
the gods he sat down near Zeus, his father, and
showed him the immortal blood flowing from his
wound.  "What thinkest thou," he said, speaking
in a pitiful voice, "of these deeds of violence?
Thou art the author of this wound; for it is thy
weak indulgence which makes thy daughter, Athene,
so violent and unruly.  Nothing but the speed of
my feet saved me from worse outrage."
</p>

<p>
But the injured Ares found scant sympathy from
his father.  "Come not to me," he said sternly,
"with thy whining complaints.  Blame thy mother
for what thou hast suffered; for to her thou owest
the froward temper which makes thee the most
hateful to me of all my children.  Nevertheless
I will not leave thee in pain, for thou art my son,
the child of my wedded love.  Were it not so, I
would have found thee a place in the dungeons
where the Titans groan."  Then he laid his
commands upon PÃ¦an, the god of healing, who
sprinkled powerful remedies on the wound, which
gave instant relief.  Swift as is the action of the
fig-juice when it falls with eager droppings[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>] into
milk, and turns it to curd, so quickly closed the
wound under the skilful hands of PÃ¦an.  And
when he had bathed, Ares sat down, hale and
whole, by his father's side.

<h3>
The Battle Continued: Hector and Andromache
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Having driven Ares from the field, Hera
and Athene returned to Olympus, leaving
the battle to be decided by human strength
and valour.  Soon the numbers and prowess of
the Greeks began to prevail, and the Trojans were
gradually forced back towards their walls.  At this
critical moment Hector, who hitherto had played
but a secondary part in the battle, was suddenly
inspired with almost superhuman courage and
energy, and by his example the Trojans were
saved from a general rout.  Having allayed the
panic, he left the other leaders to make head
against the enemy, and went himself into the city,
with the purpose of ordering a general sacrifice
and supplication, to avert the anger of Athene.
</p>

<p>
Both armies were growing weary of the long
struggle, and during Hector's absence the work of
slaughter ceased for a time by mutual consent.
Diomede alone kept the field, and stalked about
in the space between the two armies, eyeing the
ranks of the Trojans, and seeking for a foeman
worthy of his steel.  Glaucus, the Lycian captain,
marked his defiant attitude, and strode forward
undaunted to the encounter.  When they were
met in the middle of the plain, Diomede accosted
him with haughty mien, and said: "Who art
thou, bold sir, that hast dared to match thyself
with me?  Unhappy are the parents whose sons
affront my might.[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>]  If thou be a god, I will not
meddle with thee, for I fear to lift my hand again
to fight with the sons of heaven.  But if thou art
of the race of men, that live by bread, come on,
and I will give thee to thy doom.  But first tell
me thy name and thy race."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] "And with their darkness durst <i>affront</i> his
light."&mdash;Milton, <i>P.L.</i> i.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Valiant son of Tydeus," answered Glaucus,
"why askest thou my race?  As the leaves which
clothe the woods in spring, to be scattered by
autumn winds, such are the generations of men:
one riseth up, and another is passing away.
Nevertheless, if thou desirest to know my race,
know that I am sprung from the line of Sisyphus,
through my grandsire Bellerophon, who came as
an exile to Lycia, banished from his native Corinth
by a woman's spite.  For, while he was dwelling
as a guest in the house of Pr&oelig;tus, King of Corinth,
the Queen Anteia poisoned her husband's ears
against him, because he had refused to be her
partner in crime, and Pr&oelig;tus believed her lying
tale, and sought opportunity to destroy Bellerophon.
So he sent him on an embassy to the King of
Lycia, the father of Anteia, and gave him a sealed
packet to take with him.  Bellerophon set sail,
and after a fair voyage he landed in Lycia, and
went up to the palace of the King.  Then for nine
days the King made good cheer, and invited the
highest in the land to meet his noble guest; and
on the tenth day he asked concerning the business
which had brought him to Lycia.  Bellerophon gave
him the packet, and he opened it privately, and
found within it a folded tablet, whereon were written
these words: <i>Bellerophon is a traitor, and hath
sought to bring dishonour on our house: he must die</i>.
</p>

<p>
"When he had read the message from his
son-in-law the King was wroth, and devised means to
compass Bellerophon's death.  First, he bade him
slay the ChimÃ¦ra, a dreadful monster, with the
head of a lion, the body of a goat, and a long
coiling tail like a vast serpent.  The gods helped
Bellerophon to slay this monster, and the King then
sent him to fight against the Solymi, a fierce and
warlike tribe.  But neither they nor the Amazons,
with whom also the King bade him fight, could
work any mischief on that valiant champion.  Yet
a fourth time the King tried to take his life, and
sent an ambush of picked men to slay him by
treachery on his way back to Lycia; and
Bellerophon killed them all.
</p>

<p>
"Being now assured that his guest was the
favourite of heaven, the King retained him in his
house as an honoured guest, and gave him his
daughter to wife; and he received a fair appanage of
cornland and vineyard, and three children were born
to him, one of whom, Hippolochus, is my father.
Thus have I told thee my lineage and my race."
</p>

<p>
Diomede had listened with deep attention to the
Lycian chieftain's story, and when he had heard
him to the end he came forward with outstretched
hands and cordial words of greeting: "Thou art
a friend," he said, "of my father's house, for
&OElig;neus, my grandsire, long ago welcomed
Bellerophon as his guest, and entertained him for many
days.  I have still among my treasures a golden
cup which Bellerophon gave to his host as a parting
gift.  Therefore let us remember the ancient tie
which connects our families, and avoid each other's
spears when we meet in the press of battle.  And
let us now change armour, that all these may know
that we are friends, both we and our fathers."
</p>

<p>
So for a while that knightly pair stood with hand
clasped in hand, and gazed into each other's faces
with eyes of kindness, joined for a few brief
moments by an ancient tie of amity, but soon to be
parted by national feud.  Then Glaucus took off
his golden armour, and gave it to Diomede, without
grudging, though he received in exchange armour
of brass.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
We must now follow Hector on his errand of
piety to the town.  As he entered the gates, an
anxious crowd of Trojan women pressed round him,
with eager questions about brothers, husbands,
or sons.  He put them gently aside, bidding them
pray to the gods, and made his way through the
streets until he came to the vast pile of the royal
palace, where dwelt Priam and his fifty sons and
twelve daughters, with their wives and husbands.
Hecuba, his mother, saw him coming, and hastened
to meet him, taking with her Laodice, the fairest
of her daughters.  "What has brought thee hither,
my son?" said she, holding his hand, "is it that
the Trojans are hard pressed by the Greeks, and
thy spirit moved thee to go up to Jove's holy
temple and pray?  Wait awhile, till I bring thee
a cup of wine, that thou mayest pour a drink-offering
and then take a comfortable draught, to
refresh thee after thy sore toils."
</p>

<p>
"I will drink no wine, mother," answered
Hector, "lest I dull my spirit, and unnerve mine
arm.  Neither may I pour a drink-offering with
hands defiled by blood and the soil of battle.  But
go thou to the temple of Athene, thou and the
venerable mothers of Troy, and take with thee a
robe, the largest and the most precious which thou
hast, that thou mayest lay it on the knees of the
goddess, as an offering meet for her.  Do this, and
vow a sacrifice of twelve yearling heifers that have
never felt the goad, if so be that she will take pity
on us and our wives and little ones, and save us
from the fury of Diomede.  As for me, I go to
find Paris, and rouse him to play a man's part
among the defenders of Troy."
</p>

<p>
Having despatched his mother on that bootless
errand, Hector went to visit Paris in his luxurious
home, which was built on the same hill where stood
the palace of Priam.  Clad in all his brazen mail,
and carrying in his hand a spear eleven cubits
long, he crossed the threshold, and passed on to
Helen's bower, where Paris was sitting, with his
armour strewn around him, fitting new feathers to
his arrows.  The great warrior stood awhile,
gazing in silence at his unworthy brother; then smiling
bitterly he said: "I perceive that thou art wroth
with thy poor countrymen seeing that thou leavest
them to perish, while thou art dallying here.  Rouse
thee, Paris," he added, changing his tone; "the
flames of war, which thou hast kindled, are blazing
round our walls.  Shake off this unmanly sloth,
and play the man for once."
</p>

<p>
"Hector, I feel the justice of thy reproaches,"
answered Paris.  "But it was sorrow, not anger, that
kept me in my chamber.  But away with regrets!
My turn will come, and I am resolved to go back to
the battle, urged thereto both by Helen's entreaties
and by thy biting words.  Wait while I don my
armour&mdash;or go thou first, and I will overtake thee."
</p>

<p>
Hector turned to go, without answering a word;
but Helen, who was present with her handmaids,
laid her hand upon his arm, and said: "Leave me
not thus, dear brother!  Kill me not by thine
accusing silence!  Unhappy that I am, the sport
and victim of evil powers, given over to perdition
from my birth!  And if I needs must sin, could I
not at least have sinned for a man, and not have
wrecked my life for a caitiff like this, without
conscience, without heart?  But sit thee down, Hector,
and rest awhile, for on thee lies heaviest the burden
which has been laid upon thy city for my sake, and
for the sake of Paris, an ill-starred pair, whose evil
fate shall be a theme of song in days to come."
</p>

<p>
"Seek not to detain me, Helen," answered
Hector gently; "my duty calls me hence, and I
must join my faithful comrades, whom I left in
the toil and heat of the fray.  Thither am I bound,
when I have taken one look&mdash;it may be for the
very last time&mdash;at my house, and my wife, and my
little child.  Look thou that Paris keeps his word,
and joins me before I quit the town."
</p>

<p>
With hasty step Hector left the house, and went
to his own home, which was close by.  Learning
there from a handmaid that Andromache had
gone with her child and his nurse to watch the
battle from the tower of the citadel, he went back
to look for her there.  As he ascended the steep
path which led to the tower, the quick ear of
Andromache recognised his footstep, and she ran
to meet him, followed by the nurse, who carried
the little Astyanax, a lovely boy, fair as the
morning star, the sweet pledge of their wedded love.
She clasped her husband's hand, and said, with a
look of fond reproach in her tearful eyes: "Rash
man, it will be thine undoing, this hardy spirit of
thine!  At thee every spear is pointed, when thou
goest into battle, and soon, very soon, the Greeks
will take thy life.  Then who shall be my defender,
and who shall guard thy child, when thou art gone?
I shall be left alone in the world, for all my kith
and kin have perished.  My father, EÃ«tion, was
slain by Achilles, when he sacked my native city,
the stately town of Thebes; and his tomb lies in the
shadow of a fair grove of elms, planted there by the
nymphs to do him honour.  Seven brothers I had,
who grew up with me in my home; and they were
slain by Achilles in a cattle raid, and one grave
received them all.  My mother Achilles released for
gold, and she went back to her father's house; but she
also is no more, slain by the gentle shafts of Artemis.

<br />
Hector's Farewell. Friedrich Preller, Jr. By permission of F. Bruckmann, Munich
</p>

<p>
"Hector, thou art my father, my mother, my
brother, my husband, my life, my all!  Leave me
not to perish in lonely widowhood with a fatherless
child.  Call the people within the walls, and fight
no more in the open plain.  Why wilt thou hazard
thy life against such fearful odds?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear love, it cannot be," answered Hector
sadly; "what would my brethren say, if I bade
them skulk like cowards behind their walls?  No;
I must go where honour calls me, though I know
that Troy is doomed with all her sons.  Yea, the
day shall dawn when temple and tower shall go
down, and these streets shall run with Trojan
blood.  Then many a noble dame shall be led
away captive, and among them&mdash;bitter, bitter
thought!&mdash;thou shalt go, to eat the hard bread of
bondage, and do menial service under a haughty
mistress.  Methinks I see thee, stooping under thy
burden, as thou bearest water from some Grecian
spring, while men point the finger at thee, and cry
in scorn: 'Hail, Andromache, wife of Hector,
Troy's bravest champion!'  May death overtake
me, and hide me deep in darkness and the grave,
before ever I see thee dragged into slavery by
ruffian hands."
</p>

<p>
A long silence followed, broken only by the
sobs of Andromache, who was overpowered by
the dreadful picture conjured up by her husband's
words.  At last Hector beckoned to the nurse, who
had been standing a little apart, to bring him the
child, and stretched out his arms to receive him;
but the little one clung crying to his nurse's breast,
affrighted by the brazen helmet and its nodding
plume.  His father and mother exchanged a loving
smile, and Hector removed his helmet, and, laying
it on the ground, took the boy in his arms, kissed
him, and fondled him, and then put up this prayer
to heaven: "Father Zeus, and all ye gods, grant
that this, my child, may be strong and valiant in fight,
even as I am, and win him honour among the Trojans;
and may his mother's heart be glad when he comes
back from the war laden with the spoils of the foe."
</p>

<p>
Then he gave the child to his mother, who
pressed him to her bosom with a tearful smile.
"Now I must leave thee," he said, with a tender
gesture: "and mourn not overmuch for me.  I shall
not die before my day: every man has his appointed
time, be he noble or base.  Thou hast thy tasks, I
mine; let us both play our part bravely, and leave
the rest to heaven."
</p>

<p>
With many a pause and many a backward glance
Andromache left him, and went back to her house,
with her heart full of sad foreboding.  When she
was gone, Hector remained standing for awhile,
lost in sorrowful thought.  He was about to turn
away when he heard the clatter of hurrying feet,
and Paris came running up, glittering in his
new-burnished armour, and tossing his plume, like
some wanton, stall-fed steed.  For he was a stout
fellow, though a coward at heart, and was full of
vigour and animal spirits after his long rest.
"Who is the laggard now?" cried the gay holiday
soldier, with a loud laugh.  "Art thou ready to go,
or shall I wait for thee awhile?"
</p>

<p>
"Forget my harsh words," answered Hector
mildly.  "I was vexed on thy account, when I saw
thee hanging back, and heard the Trojans speak
evil of thee.  Let us forget our quarrels, and fight
side by side for hearth and home; perhaps we may
yet live to see happier days."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
Second Battle: Repulse of the Greeks
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The result of the first day's fighting had been
all in favour of the Greeks, but, as many
had fallen on both sides, a truce was made
by mutual consent for the next day, to enable both
armies to bury their dead.  By the advice of Nestor
the Greeks dug a trench and threw up a rampart
for the defence of their camp, and by the zealous
labour of that vast multitude the work was finished
on the same night.
</p>

<p>
Zeus had not forgotten his promise to Thetis,
and on the morning of the third day he summoned
all the gods to council, and thus declared his will:
"Hear me, all ye gods and goddesses, and let none
dare to cross my purpose.  I forbid any among
you to take part in the battle to-day, and if
any disobey me I will take him and fling him into
Tartarus, the black and gloomy pit, as far
beneath Hades as heaven is above the earth.
Then shall ye learn how much mightier am I
than ye all together."
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for question or reply, the lord
of Olympus mounted his car, and swept along his
airy road until he came to the mountain-range of
Ida, overlooking the Trojan plain.  There he halted
and took his station on Mount Gargarus, the highest
peak of Ida, from which he had a complete view
of Troy and the Grecian camp.
</p>

<p>
Forth sallied the rival hosts, and soon the clash
of arms rang through the cool morning air, as Greek
grappled with Trojan in deadly conflict.  All
through the long hours, until noon, the issue
remained doubtful; but when the sun stood at the
zenith Zeus lifted a pair of golden scales, and
weighed the fates of Greeks and Trojans; and the
scale which held the fate of the Greeks sank down,
heavy with defeat and disaster.  Then Zeus
thundered with a mighty peal from Ida, and hurled
his bolt among the thronging ranks of the Greeks;
and they were sore amazed, and pale Fear gat hold
of them.  Not one among them dared to stand his
ground, neither Ajax, nor Idomeneus, nor
Agamemnon himself.  Only Nestor lagged behind, for
he was hindered by the fall of one of his horses,
which had been pierced through the brain by Paris
with an arrow.  Nestor sprang down, and began
cutting through the traces with his sword; and
while he was thus engaged, Hector came thundering
past in hot pursuit of the Greeks, and seeing
Nestor's plight turned aside to slay him.  Diomede
saw the old man's danger, and lashing his horses
to a gallop drove instantly to his aid.  "Mount,
mount," he cried, "with me, and leave to my
squires these sorry steeds of thine.  Take thou the
reins, and we will see if we can check the onset of
the Trojans, and arrest Hector's destroying arm."
</p>

<p>
Nestor was not slow to obey the summons, and
mounting by the side of Diomede he drove straight
at Hector.  Then Diomede flung his spear, and
struck down Hector's charioteer, and, pursuing his
advantage, he fell fiercely on the broken columns
of the Trojans, scattered in wild pursuit of the
enemy.  Already the Greeks were beginning to
rally, when Zeus hurled a second bolt, which
crashed down before the feet of the horses of
Diomede.  "We must fly," said Nestor; "heaven
is against us," and wheeling the affrighted steeds
he followed the main body of the Greeks, who were
now in full retreat towards the ships.  That was
a bitter moment for the gallant Diomede, when he
heard the exulting voice of Hector, calling him
coward, minion, woman.  But peal after peal came
from the frowning peak of Ida, now wrapped in
black clouds; and that proud spirit was forced to
bow to a higher power.
</p>

<p>
"On, Trojans, on!" shouted Hector, pushing on
at full speed to head the pursuit.  "Zeus favours
our cause, and the Greeks are doomed.  Neither
walls, nor moat, nor all their sorry devices, shall
stay our fury, but we will burn their ships and cut
them off to a man."  So on they sped, driving the
Greeks before them across the plain, even to the
very gates of the camp.  Here the leaders turned
at bay, and Agamemnon succeeded by desperate
efforts in restoring some order in the panic-stricken
host.  Foremost among the defenders of the camp
were Ajax, the greater and the less, Idomeneus and
his comrade, Meriones, Diomede, and Teucer the
half-brother of the greater Ajax.  Teucer especially,
who was a famous archer, did splendid service
to the Greeks in that dreadful strait.  Crouched
behind the vast orb of his mighty kinsman's shield
he watched his opportunity, and shot down man after
man as the Trojans came rushing to the assault.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, brave bowman!" cried Agamemnon,
who was standing near, as the eighth victim to
Teucer's skill bit the dust.  "Now aim an arrow
at yonder mad dog"; and he pointed at Hector,
who was leading the attack.  Again the bow
twanged, but this time he missed his mark, and
instead of Hector struck another son of Priam, who
was fighting by his brother's side.  And as droops
the poppyflower in a fair garden plot, heavy with
its seed-pod, and drenched with the summer rains,
so drooped that comely head, oppressed by the
weight of its helmet.
</p>

<p>
"Nine have I slain," cried Teucer, in triumph.
"Now let me see if my tenth arrow will bring
down this noble quarry"; and once more he pointed
a shaft at Hector's breast.  But a second time the
arrow went amiss, and pierced through the heart
of Hector's charioteer.  Cebriones, Hector's brother,
succeeded to this dangerous office, thus twice left
vacant on one day; while Hector himself sprang
to the ground, and picking up a stone hurled it at
Teucer, who was just fitting another arrow to his
bowstring.  The stone struck Teucer on the
collar-bone, breaking the bowstring, and paralysing his
arm.  Ajax sprang forward to cover his injured
brother, who was carried, groaning with pain, to
the shelter of the ships.
</p>

<p>
The fall of Teucer struck fresh dismay into the
Greeks, who now shrank back behind their defences,
Hector following them close, and cutting down the
stragglers, like a hound hanging on the flanks of
a wild boar.  When the last man had passed the
barriers the gates were shut, and Hector was left
outside, glaring with baffled rage.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Deep was the wrath of Hera when she saw her
darling Greeks driven like sheep before the
exultant Trojans, and huddled in wild disorder behind
their ramparts.  As the voice of Hector rang out
above the din, like a trumpet sounding the charge,
she rocked herself with fury in her seat, and at last,
being able to contain herself no longer, she cried
to Athene: "I will not endure it!  Come what
may, I will save my Greeks from perishing by the
hands of that mad Trojan."
</p>

<p>
"It is the hand of Zeus," answered Athene,
"that hath brought these foul deeds to pass, in
fulfilment of the promise which he made to Thetis,
when she clasped his knees, and besought him to
honour her son.  Graceless, thankless god!  Did
I not serve him day and night, when I watched like
a mother over Heracles, his favourite son, and
saved him from a thousand perils?  And this is my
reward, to be crossed in all my designs, and robbed
of my just revenge, by him, my false father, who
fools me with his caresses, and calls me his dear,
grey-eyed maid!  But go thou and harness our
steeds, while I put on my armour, and we will try
whether Hector will blench or not when he sees
my spear flashing among the dykes of war,[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>] and
the Trojans falling thick and fast, to glut the dogs
and vultures with their fat and their flesh."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] The armed columns, which keep back the <i>flood</i> of battle.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Not a minute elapsed before the rebellious
goddesses were equipped for battle, and ready to swoop
like eagles on the heads of the hated Trojans.  But
Zeus had been watching their movements, and
summoning Iris he sent her with a stern,
imperious message to his mutinous wife and child.
Prompt at his command, Iris sped on her rainbow
wings to Olympus, and met the angry pair as they
were issuing from the gates.  "Are ye mad?" she
said, confronting them with warning looks.  "Listen
to my message, and get ye back the way ye came.
Thus saith the son of Cronos, and his words shall
surely come to pass: he will maim the swift steeds
which draw your car, and blast you with his
lightnings, and shatter your chariot wheels, and for ten
long years ye shall not be healed of the wounds
from those corrosive fires.  Then shall thou learn,
thou grey-eyed maid, what it means to fight with
thy sire."
</p>

<p>
Both Hera and Athene knew full well how far
they might presume on the indulgence of Zeus,
and without another word they turned back to
Olympus, unyoked their steeds, and with quaking
hearts joined the company of the gods.  Soon after,
the monarch of Olympus entered, and took his seat
on his exalted throne; for he had returned from
Ida when his business for the day was ended.
Not a word, not a look, did he receive in greeting
from his wife and daughter; but he knew their
thoughts, and said: "Why sit ye thus dismayed,
Hera and Athene?  It cannot be that ye are
wearied from doing battle with the Trojans, against
whom ye have so dire a grudge, for ye were seized
with trembling before ever ye had looked into the
face of war.  And well for you that it was so!&mdash;or
your warring should have had a fearful end."
</p>

<p>
Athene remained cowed and silent, but the
shrewish Hera, though she too was scared by her
husband's anger, could not hold her peace, but
muttered a few words of complaint and remonstrance,
of which only the words "faithful Greeks"
and "unmerited disaster" were audible.  But Zeus
was in no mood for contradiction, and he cut her
short with this peremptory announcement of his
purpose: "To-morrow, if thou wilt, thou shalt see
thy 'faithful Greeks' plunged yet deeper in
'unmerited disaster.'  They shall have no respite from
slaughter and defeat until the swift-footed son of
Peleus shall once more be roused to arms.  Go
then, and fill heaven and earth with thy rage and
thy fury&mdash;go down to Tartarus, if thou choosest,
and tell thy wrongs to the demons who dwell
in that sunless den."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>

<p>
Night fell at last, bringing relief to the
sore-stricken Greeks, and compelling the reluctant
Trojans to suspend their attack on the camp.
Hector drew off his forces, and pitched his camp by
the riverside.  This was a sign of great confidence
on the part of the Trojans, who hitherto had rarely
ventured outside their walls, and had always
returned to the city at nightfall.  But now the
besiegers had become the besieged, and active
preparations were made for a campaign in the open
field.  Orders were sent to the city for supplies of
corn and wine and cattle to victual the camp, and
the elders of Troy were warned to keep a vigilant
watch during the night, to guard against surprise.
</p>

<p>
When these measures of prudence were completed,
Hector, who had been the leading spirit
through all this eventful day, summoned the Trojan
chieftains to a council of war.  High and proud was
his glance, as he stood leaning on his tall spear,
with its point of tempered bronze and its socket of
gold; for he dreamt of nothing less than the total
rout and discomfiture of the Greeks.  And he
found ready hearers in the leaders of the Trojans
and their allies, who read in his looks an augury of
triumph and victory.  "This day," he said, "I
thought to have destroyed the Grecian fleet and
army, and to have offered thanks to the gods of our
country in the Trojan citadel.  For this time night
has saved them from utter ruin; but the blow is
only delayed, not averted, and to-morrow we will
set the finish to this glorious work.  Let every
man now get to his supper with good heart and
hope, and look ye to it that numerous fires be
lighted in the camp, sufficient to illuminate all the
country round, as far as to the fleet.  For I fear
that these hounds will try to escape under cover of
night, and I would not that they should leave us
without some token of our loving-kindness&mdash;some
deep mark in their flesh from Trojan arrow or
spear to remember us by when they reach their
homes in Greece.  If they abide here till to-morrow,
the better for us, and the worse for them!  Then
shall Diomede, the mighty son of Tydeus, pay the
price of the lives which he has taken, and to-morrow's
sun shall behold him lying stiff and stark,
with all his comrades heaped in slaughter around him."
</p>

<p>
Having listened to the words of their great
captain, the leaders dispersed to their several
quarters to carry out his orders.  And the swift
southern night came down, wrapping sea and land
in shadow.  But soon the realm of darkness was
invaded by the flame of a thousand fires.  Thick as
are the stars which cluster round the moon on a
windless summer night, gladdening the shepherd's
heart as he keeps his lonely vigil among the hills,
so thick shone the fires of the Trojans in the space
between the river and the ships.  By every fire sat
fifty men, and their horses stood near at hand,
tethered to the cars, cropping their barley and
waiting for the dawn.

<h3>
The Embassy to Achilles
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
So the Trojans held their bivouac, and
whiled away the time with drinking, and
music, and song.  Far other were the feelings
of the cowed and beaten Greeks.  Many a
warrior lay sleepless on his uneasy couch, tossed on
a troubled sea of anxiety and dread.  Among the
leaders there was no thought of rest, and they soon
received a hasty summons to attend a council in
Agamemnon's quarters.  Small comfort had they
to receive from the lips of their king, who was
utterly broken and cast down, and had nothing to
advise but instant flight.  A long silence followed
his despairing words, and the first to speak was
Diomede, whose young and elastic spirit made him
a bright exception amid the general despondency of
his comrades.  Indignantly rejecting the cowardly
counsels of Agamemnon, he avowed his intention
of remaining and carrying on the war with his
single troop, if all the rest of the Greeks deserted
their posts.  His bold words rekindled the courage
of the rest, and they all joined their voices in a
fixed resolution to remain and fight out their quarrel
to the last.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," said Nestor, who was the next to
speak.  "Thou art a proper youth, young son of
Tydeus, worthy to take the lead in council and
in fight.  But now listen to an old man's advice.
The Trojans are holding their leaguer within
sight of our gates, and may make an onfall at
any moment; therefore let a watch be set by the
moat outside the camp, and let this charge be
given to the young men.  We, the elders, have
a graver matter to consider&mdash;how we may end
the lamentable feud which has brought division
among us, and made us an easy prey to our enemies."
</p>

<p>
The matter thus obscurely hinted at by Nestor
was, of course, the quarrel between Achilles and
Agamemnon; and as soon as the watch was set,
and left under the charge of Antilochus, Nestor's
eldest son, the old King of Pylos reopened
the debate with these words: "To thee, mighty
son of Atreus, I will address myself, for thou
art the vicegerent of Zeus, and holdest the
sceptre of righteousness which thou hast received
from his hands.  Great is thy place, and high the
trust imposed in thee&mdash;even the lives and fortunes
of all this people.  Therefore will I speak roundly
with thee, concealing nothing which is in my heart.
Thou hast erred, great sovereign, thou hast erred
grievously, in putting public dishonour on the
bravest and most illustrious champion in all thy
host.  It is thine act which hath brought us to this
pass; and it is for thee to make restitution, that
he may cease from his sore anger, and incline his
heart unto us again."
</p>

<p>
Far from showing any resentment at Nestor's
plain speaking, Agamemnon freely confessed his
fault.  "I have sinned," he said, "yea, I have
sinned grievously, in the great blindness of my
heart.  But, thanks be to heaven!  I am both able
and willing to atone for the wrong which I have
done.  Attend, while I declare unto you the
ransom which I will pay unto Achilles to wipe out the
stain upon his honour.  Vessels of silver will I give
him, and vessels of bronze, ten talents of gold, and
twelve steeds, all prizewinners, which have won
me much wealth by the speed of their feet.  Also
I will give him seven women, my bondservants,
skilled in all manner of needlework, whom I won
at the sack of Lesbos; and with them shall go
Briseis, who, since I took her from him, has lived
in all honour with the ladies of my retinue.  And if
ever the gods grant us to capture the city of Priam
he shall have a shipload of treasure, and twenty
Trojan ladies, the noblest and the fairest, as his
share of the spoil.  Moreover, when we return
home from the war, he shall be as a son of my
house, and I will give him one of my daughters in
marriage, without money and without price,[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] and
will add a rich dower besides.  And he shall be a
prince of my land, and lord of seven fair cities,
honoured and obeyed as a god by those that dwell
therein.  Surely, if he hath a human heart, he
cannot turn away from me, his monarch, and his
elder, when I come to him with full hands,
beseeching him to forgive."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The King's magnificent offer drew warm words
of praise from the chiefs, and nothing now remained
but to choose those who were to be entrusted with
this important embassy.  At the suggestion of
Nestor it was decided to send Ph&oelig;nix, an aged
noble, who was connected with Achilles by close
ties of early affection, Odysseus, and the greater
Ajax.  After a few words of warning and counsel
from Nestor, they were despatched forthwith to the
tent of Achilles, and with them went two heralds,
to give greater solemnity to their mission.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
So together they passed along the level sand,
with many a prayer to Poseidon, lord of the sea,
that they might easily persuade the mighty heart of
Ã†acides.[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>]  And when they came to the tents and
ships of the Myrmidons, they found Achilles sitting
at the door of his tent, and soothing his troubled
spirit with song, and the clear music of a harp,
which he had taken among the spoil of EÃ«tion's
city.  Opposite to him sat Patroclus, the most
beloved of his comrades, waiting until Achilles
should have finished his lay, whose theme was the
deeds of famous men.  And they came and stood
before him, with Odysseus at their head.  When
Achilles saw them he gave a cry of surprise, and
sprang from his seat, harp in hand; and Patroclus
rose up with him.  Then, greeting them with a
courteous gesture, he said: "Welcome, dear friends!
Most welcome are ye of all the Greeks, even in this
hour of my displeasure.  Be seated.  I know why
ye have come hither&mdash;sore indeed is the need."  So
saying, he led the way into the tent, and as soon
as they were seated he called to Patroclus, saying:
"Set forth the largest bowl, and open the oldest
cask of wine, to do honour to the dear guests who
have come under my roof."
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
<a id="chap08fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn2text">2</a>] Grandson of Ã†acus, the father of Peleus.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Therewith he placed a table, in the light of the
fire, and on it he laid the loin of a sheep and
another of a fat goat, and the chine of a hog.
Automedon, his squire, held the meat, and Achilles
with his own hands cut it into slices, spitted it, and
roasted it over the glowing embers.  When all
was ready, they feasted sumptuously, and drank of
the rich wine which Achilles poured out without
stint.  The banquet being ended, Ajax made a
sign to Ph&oelig;nix; but Odysseus took the word from
him, and, rising with a full cup in his hand, pledged
Achilles, and said: "I drink to thee, son of Peleus,
and thank thee for thy good cheer.  Never have I
tasted choicer fare, not even in the tent of
Agamemnon himself.  But, alas! my noble host, we
have little heart for feasting and making merry,
for we stand on the very brink of ruin, and thou
alone canst save us.  The Trojans have pitched
their camp before our very gates, and it will not be
long before they sweep us into the sea.  Zeus hath
openly taken sides with our foes, and affrights us
with thunders and with lightnings; and Hector,
full of mad presumption, is breathing out threatenings
and slaughter against us.  I fear&mdash;yea, I fear
exceedingly&mdash;that the god will accomplish his
threats, and that we are indeed doomed to perish in
the land of Troy, far from our native Argos.  Up,
then, and gird thee to the fight, if thou art minded
to save the sons of Greece, even in the eleventh
hour.  If thou wait longer the mischief will be done,
and thou wilt repent of thy stubbornness too late.
Remember the words of thy father, Peleus, when he
sent thee to the war: 'My son, thou art very strong,
but this good gift thou owest to heaven.  Do thou
curb thy haughty spirit, and turn thee to thoughts
of kindness, if thou wouldst be honoured of old
and young.'  Thou hast forgotten the good words of
thy father, and given place to malice and
uncharitableness.  Quit this froward mood, and mark while
I tell thee the brave gifts which Agamemnon offers
as the price of thy good will."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly Odysseus went on to recite the whole
tale of the royal bounty, and when the list was
complete he wound up his speech by appealing at once
to the humanity, the pride, and the ambition of
Achilles.  "If thou despisest Agamemnon and his
gifts, take pity on thy poor countrymen, who will
honour thee as a god, and glorify thee as their
preserver.  And now thou mayest slay Hector, for
assuredly he will not refrain from thee in the frenzy
which possesseth him, boasting that there is none
to match him among all the Greeks who sailed to Troy."
</p>

<p>
Odysseus resumed his seat, and amidst a breathless
silence Achilles rose up and began to speak,
calmly at first, but rising in passion as he proceeded.
"Most noble son of Laertes, I will answer thee
bluntly and to the purpose, that ye may know my
mind, and may not come hither on this errand
again.  For hateful to me, even as the gates of
death, is the man who hides one thing in his
heart, and speaks another.  Hear, then, what I
have to say.  Neither Agamemnon, nor all the
Greeks together, shall turn me from my purpose.
I have fought&mdash;thou knowest how I have fought&mdash;against
the common foe; and what my reward hath
been thou knowest also.  Like a mother bird, who
flies to and fro, never weary, never resting, carrying
morsels to her nestlings, while she remains empty
herself, so have I passed my days in war and
bloodshed, and my nights in sleepless watchings, putting
my life in jeopardy, for the sake of another man's
wife.  Twelve cities have I sacked, sailing the sea
in my ships, and eleven on land, within the realm
of Troy.  First the toil, which was mine, and after
that the spoil, which was his.  I brought it all, and
laid it at his feet, and he kept the greater part by
far, giving me back a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;for all
my pains.  And that little he hath taken away.  Let
him keep it, and joy go with it!  I loved the maid
Briseis, yea, dearly I loved her!  Thinketh he that
he alone and his brother love their wives?  She
was my prize, my bride: he hath torn her from
mine arms, and that foul deed I will never forgive.
</p>

<p>
"And as to the gifts which he offers, let him
know that I came here to fight for honour, not for
pelf.  He hath denied mine honour, and now he
would bribe me to erase that dark record with a
purse of gold.  But I will not be bribed.  Away
with his gifts!  I value them not a straw.  Not
though he offered me ten times and twenty times
as much&mdash;all the wealth that he hath, or ever shall
have&mdash;not for all the riches of Egyptian Thebes,
which sends forth ten thousand warriors, with
chariots, and with horses, from its hundred
gates&mdash;no, not for treasures unnumbered as the sands
and dust of the earth&mdash;could he buy pardon of me,
until he hath suffered the full penalty of the outrage
which devours my heart.
</p>

<p>
"Long ago my mother gave me the choice of
two diverse fates&mdash;short life with honour, or long
life without a name.  Mine honour is lost&mdash;therefore
I will cling to my life, and live it out to the
end.  Thy miser king holds that men's lives are
to be bought and sold, as the lives of sheep and
oxen; but herein he is mistaken again.  Wealth
may be won, and lost, and won back again, seized
by the strong hand, or heaped up slowly by
plodding industry; but the breath of our life cannot
be called back again, when once it hath passed the
door of our lips.  Therefore I am determined to
end my days in peace and quietness among my
own people, and quit these brawls, which concern
not me.  And I counsel all the rest to do the same,
for it is clear that Troy's overthrow is not to be
wrought by you.
</p>

<p>
"Ye have heard my answer; go tell it to the
chiefs, and bid them be assured that they have
naught to hope from me."
</p>

<p>
Deep was the disappointment of the three
envoys, as they followed the wild eloquence of
that fierce and implacable man.  For a long time
not a word was spoken, for it seemed vain to argue
against such passion and pride.  At last the
venerable Ph&oelig;nix rose feebly from his place, and in a
voice broken with sobs and tears began a discourse
of immense length, full of tender personal
reminiscence and old-world legend.  This old man had a
curious history.  Born to wealth and power, he
became an exile in his youth, having been cursed
by his father, whom he had bitterly provoked in
the course of a family feud.  In consequence of
the curse he remained a childless man, and, finding
a new home in the land of Peleus, he lavished more
than a father's tenderness on Achilles, Peleus'
infant son.
</p>

<p>
These incidents from his own life, which he
dwelt on with the fond garrulity of an old nurse,
furnished a copious theme to Ph&oelig;nix in the first
part of his harangue.  "I little thought," he said,
"when I set thee on my knee, a little, helpless
babe, and fed thee with choice morsels of meat,
and held the cup to thy lips, and thou wouldst
spill the wine over my gown in thy childish
weakness&mdash;I little thought to see thee grow up to be so
pitiless and inflexible, more hard to move than the
gods themselves, whom we approach with prayer
and sacrifice, and with bended knees.  Beware of
the vengeance which waits upon a stubborn and
unforgiving heart.  Swift and strong is the dread
goddess Ate, who prompts man to give and take
offence; but Penitence is an old and wrinkled
goddess, who goes halting behind her, to heal the
mischief; and if he who is wronged will not listen
to her voice he himself becomes the offender, and
the whole guilt of the quarrel rests on his head.
Hearken thou, therefore, to her gentle pleading,
and receive the bountiful gifts of Agamemnon, or
the day will come when thou wilt take thy sword
perforce, and fight the battles of the Greeks
without reward."
</p>

<p>
Achilles listened with manifest impatience to the
rambling appeals of Ph&oelig;nix; and when at length
the old man had finished, he replied briefly: "I
seek no reward but the favour of Zeus, which I
have, and shall not cease to have as long as the
breath of life is in me.  Vex me no more with thy
vain repinings; my purpose is fixed, and it is for
thee to choose whether thou wilt be friends with
Agamemnon or with me.  If thou art on my side
remain here for the night, and to-morrow we will
consider whether we will go or stay."
</p>

<p>
The conference was brought to a close by a
few words from Ajax, whose frank and soldierly
heart was hot with indignation at the vindictive
temper of Achilles.  Turning to Odysseus, he said:
"Noble son of Laertes, let us be going.  Words
are wasted on this fierce and froward man.  Surely
he has a heart of stone, which no kindly thought,
no gentle memory of ancient comradeship, can
soften.  All the homage of his countrymen, all
the loving-kindness of his friends, are as dirt
beneath his feet.  Many a man hath accepted a
price for the blood of a son or brother slain, and
suffered the slayer to remain unharmed in the
land; but thou, Achilles, hast scorned the most
princely offers for the sake of one captive maid.
O yet at last be moved!  Bring not scorn upon us,
thy guests, thy friends, but give us a gentle answer
to take back to our countrymen in their dire need."
</p>

<p>
These manly and moving words had some effect
on Achilles, half maddened as he was by wounded
pride.  Yet still he would not yield, though his
answer showed that he had not been in earnest
when he spoke of abandoning the war.  "Thou
hast spoken well, Ajax," he said, "and there is
much reason in what thou sayest.  But my heart
boils with rage when I think of the contumely
which was heaped upon me before the eyes of all
Greece, as though I were some beggared and
nameless outcast; and I will not put on mine
armour again, until I see the smoke arising from
the Grecian ships, and Hector drawing near to my
galleys with sword and fire.  Then, methinks, his
career of victory will end."
</p>

<p>
After this final declaration of his purpose by
Achilles, Ajax and Odysseus took their leave, and
returned to the assembled chieftains, who still
sat anxiously awaiting the result of the mission.
Ph&oelig;nix remained behind, having resolved to cast
in his lot with Achilles.

<h3>
The Night Raid on the Trojan Camp
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Uneasy lay the head of Agamemnon the
King that night, and, thick as lightnings
which herald the storm, thronging cares shot
through his brain, forbidding all repose.  As often as
he opened his eyes he saw the red gleam of the Trojan
watchfires; and the hum of the armed multitude,
mingled with the strains of flute and pipe, filled his
ears.  After an hour of weary tossing he left his
couch, and wandered out into the camp, until he came
to the quarters of Menelaus, and, finding him also
afoot, he sent him to call up Ajax and Idomeneus,
and went himself to summon Nestor, intending to
hold a midnight council, and devise some plan
of relief in this hour of general depression and
dismay.
</p>

<p>
On the way he was joined by Diomede and
Odysseus, and when they all met it was resolved to
pay a visit to the sentinels and see if they were
faithful to their trust.  When they came to the place where
the pickets were stationed, outside the barriers, they
found the whole troop keeping watch and ward with
sleepless vigilance, like dogs in charge of a
sheep-fold when they hear a lion prowling without.
Every man was on the alert, with his face towards
the Trojan leaguer, as if expecting an instant attack.
Nestor's long experience of war now enabled him
to make a suggestion which led to one of the
most famous adventures in the whole course of the
war.  "Is there one among you bold enough," he
said, "to go and spy out the movements of the
Trojans in their camp, and bring back a report of
what they design against us?  'Twould be a noble
enterprise, and would bring both fame and profit to
him who should accomplish it."
</p>

<p>
There was a short pause, and then Diomede
declared himself willing to undertake this perilous
adventure, "But will not one of you go with me?"
he asked.  "Two heads are better than one, and I
may find myself in a strait in which I should need
a comrade's help and advice."
</p>

<p>
Six of the leaders at once offered to accompany
Diomede, and among these were Menelaus, Odysseus,
and Antilochus, the captain of the outpost, who
was especially eager to go.  "Choose him whom
thou thinkest best fitted for the task, without
respect to rank or birth," said Agamemnon, in fear
lest he should name Menelaus for his companion.
"Well, then," answered Diomede, "I choose
Odysseus, the hardiest and the shrewdest spirit among
us all, and the darling of Athene.  With him at
my side I will go through fire and water without
scathe."
</p>

<p>
"A truce to thy praises," said Odysseus, "and
let us away, for the night is far spent, and the day
is at hand."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Lightly armed and equipped, the stout-hearted
pair passed out of the light of the watchfires, and
set their faces towards the Trojan camp.  Just as
they were starting they heard the cry of a heron
flying on the right, and Odysseus was glad, for
he knew it was a sign sent by Athene, promising
success to their journey.  Murmuring a prayer,
they stepped forward boldly, like two lions bound
on a midnight foray, and crossed the battlefield of
yesterday, over corpses and broken armour and
pools of blood.  Suddenly Odysseus came to a halt,
and laying his hand on Diomede's arm whispered:
"I hear a footstep as of one coming this way,
whether to spy out our camp, or to plunder the
dead, I know not.  Let us allow him to go by us,
and then spring upon him as he passes."
</p>

<p>
Crouching down among the heaps of slain, they
waited until the man had passed in the direction of
the ships, and then leapt from their ambush and
gave chase.  When he heard them he hesitated
a moment, doubting whether they were friends or
foes; then, recognising them as Greeks, he bounded
away at full speed, Odysseus and Diomede following
hard behind, like two hounds on the track of a
doe or hare.  But the fellow was a fleet runner,
and would have been fairly driven into the hands
of the Greek sentinels, if Diomede had not raised
his spear, and sent it whizzing close to the ear of
the fugitive, crying as he did so: "Halt! whoever
thou art, or my next cast shall bring thee down."
</p>

<p>
Then the wretch was afraid, and stood still, in
obedience to the summons, with knees knocking
together and chattering teeth; and the two Greeks
ran up, panting for breath, and seized him by the
arms.  Weeping with terror he began to beg for
his life.  "Make me your prisoner," he faltered,
"and I will pay you a heavy ransom, for my
father's house is full of silver and gold, and
vessels of iron,[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] choicely wrought, and he will
pay you a heavy price when he hears that I am
alive."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] Iron was scarce and highly prized among the
Homeric Greeks.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Have no fears for thy life," said Odysseus;
"only answer me truly, and thou art safe.  Why
art thou wandering here in the dead of night?
Art thou on an adventure of thine own, or did
Hector send thee to spy out the Grecian camp?"
</p>

<p>
"It was Hector who beguiled me to commit this
folly," answered the captive, whose name was
Dolon; "for he bribed me with a great bribe,
promising to give me the steeds of Peleus' haughty
son, if I would go down to the fleet, and bring back
information whether you were preparing to fly from
our shores in the night."
</p>

<p>
"Thou art ambitious, I see," replied Odysseus,
smiling.  "Bold must be thy heart, and firm thy
hand, if thou wouldst drive the steeds of Ã†acides,
which are of no mortal breed.  But tell me now,
and answer me truly, where is Hector stationed
in the Trojan camp, and in what order have the
others pitched their tents?"
</p>

<p>
"Hector and the chiefs," answered Dolon, still
shaking with mortal dread, "have their quarters
by the tomb of Ilus, and round them lie the native
Trojans, keeping good watch.  The allies are
encamped about them, in no fixed order, and they are
all asleep.  On the very outskirts of the camp lie
the Thracians, and Rhesus their king; and if ye
are minded to make an onfall on their leaguer ye
may do it in safety, and win a rare prize.  For
Rhesus hath a pair of milk-white coursers, unmatched
in strength and speed, and a car richly adorned
with silver and gold.  Likewise he hath a suit of
golden armour, fit for the gods to wear.  And all
this ye may win without a blow.  Now leave me in
the custody of your comrades, or bind me fast here,
that ye may know when ye return whether I have
spoken the truth."
</p>

<p>
But that night was to afford a second instance
of broken faith, hardly less infamous than the first.
Having tempted this poor caitiff to betray his
comrades by promising him his life, they now gave
him the traitor's wage.  "Thou must die, Dolon,"
said Diomede coldly, "for all thy good news.  Thou
art a foe, delivered into our hands, and thou shalt
never spy upon us or fight with us again."  Dolon
clung to him with cries of anguished entreaty,
pleading for his life; but Diomede, with one
downward stroke of his sword, swept off his head, which
rolled, with lips still moving, in the dust.  Then
stripping off his armour, he hung it in a tamarisk
tree, and, having marked the place, went forward
with Odysseus in the direction of the Thracian
camp.
</p>

<p>
When they came to the quarters of Rhesus, they
found him lying in the midst of his men, with his
famous steeds standing near, tethered to their car.
All the troop was sleeping heavily, for they were
newly arrived at Troy, and had travelled far and
fast the day before.  "There he is," whispered
Odysseus, "and these are his steeds, a glorious pair!
Now to work!  Slay me a score of these sluggards
while I loose the steeds."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Diomede drew his sword, and struck
right and left like a headsman, until he had slain
some dozen of the sleeping Thracians; and, as he
proceeded, Odysseus dragged the slaughtered men
out of the way, to make a path for the horses, which
were young, and unused to such sights.  Diomede's
last victim was the giant Rhesus, who was breathing
heavily, and dreaming of his home; but a Grecian
blade cut short his dreams, and his fleet coursers
now found a new master.  While Diomede was
thus busy, Odysseus untethered the steeds, and
coupling them together by their harness drove
them out of the camp, striking them with a bow
which he carried; for he had forgotten to take up
the whip.  Diomede still lingered, meditating some
final act of daring, to crown the night's adventure.
Beneath him lay the corpse of Rhesus, and his golden
armour, and he was hesitating whether to take
these, or slay a few more Thracians, when Odysseus
gave a low whistle, warning him that it was time to
be going.  The next moment he heard the sound
of hurrying footsteps, and, perceiving that the
alarm had been given, he joined Odysseus, and
mounting one of the horses seized the other by
the bridle, and rode at a rapid trot towards the sea.
Odysseus ran by his side, holding on by the harness,
for he was no rider,[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>] but a swift and enduring
runner.

<a id="chap09fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn2text">2</a>] Riding was little practised among the Homeric heroes.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
They had no sooner departed than a wild
commotion arose behind them in the awakened Thracian
camp, but increasing their pace they soon reached
the spot where they had left the unhappy Dolon,
and, having paused for a moment to take up his
armour, they hurried forward, and before long they
were within hail of the Grecian outposts, where the
whole company of the leaders was still assembled,
anxiously awaiting their return.
</p>

<p>
Nestor was the first to hear the sound of the
horses' feet, and thinking that the Trojans were
attacking he ran to raise the alarm.  But he was
soon reassured when he heard the voice of Diomede,
followed a moment later by the arrival of the hardy
adventurers with their splendid booty.  Joyful were
the greetings on both sides, and when the story of
that great exploit had been briefly told they all
dispersed to their quarters, to snatch a few hours
of sleep before the toils of the coming day.

The Brave Deeds of Agamemnon: Reverses of the Greeks
</p>

<p>
In the still hours of the dawn the Greeks were
startled from their slumbers by a loud and
fearful cry, which came from no mortal lips, but
from Eris, the dread goddess of strife, who had
been sent down by Zeus to give the signal for
battle.  The first to obey that awful summons was
Agamemnon; for this was to be his great day, and
his heart was aflame with the lust of slaughter.
Springing from his couch he began to don his
armour.  First he put on his greaves, which were
made of pliant white metal, with ankle pieces of
silver.  Then he took up his corslet, with a glance
of pride, for it was of choice and costly workmanship,
cunningly fashioned of thin strips or courses
of metal.  Ten courses were of blue steel, and ten
of gold, and twenty of tin; and round about the
corslet wound three serpents, wrought in divers
colours, like the rainbow, with their heads meeting
where the corslet narrowed at the neck.  His sword
glittered with golden ornaments, and the scabbard
was of silver, and the baldric of gold.  On his shield,
which had ten circles of brass, were twenty bosses of
white tin, and in the centre a boss of blue steel; and it
bore an image of the Gorgon's head and the dreadful
faces of Rout and Panic.  Attached to it was a silver
strap, bearing the device of a serpent with three heads.
</p>

<p>
Glittering in this gorgeous panoply, brandishing
two spears, and raising his battle cry, Agamemnon
rushed to the gates of the camp, and placed
himself at the head of his bravest champions, who were
mustering there with the flower of the Greek army,
prepared for the expected attack.  They had not
long to wait; hardly had they set their ranks in
order, when the Trojans appeared on the summit
of the slope which ran down to the shore.  And
like a star which appears and disappears on a
stormy night, when the sky is covered with scudding
clouds, so glittered the mailed form of Hector, as
he ranged in and out among the advancing columns,
marshalling his men to the fight.
</p>

<p>
Then like two lines of reapers working together
on opposite sides of a deep field of wheat or barley,
so met Greeks and Trojans on the plain before the

the gods were present, save only Eris, whose savage
heart was glad when she smelt the smell of blood.
And Zeus sat apart on a lonely peak, looking down
upon Troy and the Grecian fleet and the two
warring nations in the space between.

The Brave Deeds of Agamemnon: Reverses of the Greeks
</h3>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
In the still hours of the dawn the Greeks were
startled from their slumbers by a loud and
fearful cry, which came from no mortal lips, but
from Eris, the dread goddess of strife, who had
been sent down by Zeus to give the signal for
battle.  The first to obey that awful summons was
Agamemnon; for this was to be his great day, and
his heart was aflame with the lust of slaughter.
Springing from his couch he began to don his
armour.  First he put on his greaves, which were
made of pliant white metal, with ankle pieces of
silver.  Then he took up his corslet, with a glance
of pride, for it was of choice and costly workmanship,
cunningly fashioned of thin strips or courses
of metal.  Ten courses were of blue steel, and ten
of gold, and twenty of tin; and round about the
corslet wound three serpents, wrought in divers
colours, like the rainbow, with their heads meeting
where the corslet narrowed at the neck.  His sword
glittered with golden ornaments, and the scabbard
was of silver, and the baldric of gold.  On his shield,
which had ten circles of brass, were twenty bosses of
white tin, and in the centre a boss of blue steel; and it
bore an image of the Gorgon's head and the dreadful
faces of Rout and Panic.  Attached to it was a silver
strap, bearing the device of a serpent with three heads.
</p>

<p>
Glittering in this gorgeous panoply, brandishing
two spears, and raising his battle cry, Agamemnon
rushed to the gates of the camp, and placed
himself at the head of his bravest champions, who were
mustering there with the flower of the Greek army,
prepared for the expected attack.  They had not
long to wait; hardly had they set their ranks in
order, when the Trojans appeared on the summit
of the slope which ran down to the shore.  And
like a star which appears and disappears on a
stormy night, when the sky is covered with scudding
clouds, so glittered the mailed form of Hector, as
he ranged in and out among the advancing columns,
marshalling his men to the fight.
</p>

<p>
Then like two lines of reapers working together
on opposite sides of a deep field of wheat or barley,
so met Greeks and Trojans on the plain before the
camp, and war's dread harvest began.  None of
the gods were present, save only Eris, whose savage
heart was glad when she smelt the smell of blood.
And Zeus sat apart on a lonely peak, looking down
upon Troy and the Grecian fleet and the two
warring nations in the space between.
</p>

<p>
Until the hour of noon the battle was waged
with equal fortune on both sides.  But just at the
time when a woodman in some mountain glen breaks
off his labour to prepare his midday meal, having
wearied his hands with holding the axe, the Greeks
made a vigorous charge, and broke through the
Trojan line.  Agamemnon fought in advance of
all the rest, and recognising among the enemy two
sons of Priam, who had formerly been taken captive
by Achilles and let go for a ransom, he slew them
both, and stripped off their armour.  And as a lion
slays two hapless fawns, while their dam, who is
feeding near, flies sweating with terror from the onslaught
of the mighty beast, so the Trojans saw their young
princes slain, but were helpless to aid them, being
themselves hard pressed by the victorious Greeks.
</p>

<p>
Like a famished lion who has broken into a
sheep-fold, and ravages the flock, so fell Agamemnon on
the huddled masses of the Trojans, striking about
him with sword and spear.  Presently he had an
opportunity of gratifying his private revenge; for
right before him, impeded by the press, he saw the
two sons of Antimachus, a Trojan who was bribed
with gold by Paris to oppose the restoration of
Helen.  There they stood helpless, both together
in one car, holding out their hands in supplication,
and begging him to spare their lives.  "There is
no mercy for such as you," cried Agamemnon
fiercely.  "Did not your father, in the hearing of
all the people, advise the murder of my brother,
Menelaus, when he came on an embassy to Troy?
Die, and pay for your father's treachery."  With
that he thrust down one of them with his spear, and
the other, who turned to fly, he slew with his sword,
lopping off head and arms, and spurning the trunk
with his foot, so that it rolled like a log along the
ground.  Then, raising his battle cry, he plunged
into the thick of the fight, where the main body of
the Trojans were flying before the Greeks, horse
and foot mingled together in headlong rout.  And
as a fire sweeps through the dry brushwood, borne
onward by the wind, and leaving a black waste
behind, so thick and fast fell the Trojans before
Agamemnon; and many an empty car went rattling
over the field, borne hither and thither by its affrighted
steeds, whose master was lying where he fell, until
the vultures assembled to the banquet at eventide.
</p>

<p>
Across the plain they sped, past the tomb of Ilus
and the wild fig-tree, making straight for the city,
and as they came to the gates they turned at bay,
and waited for those who were still flying before
Agamemnon and the Greeks.
</p>

<p>
"Now haste thee, swift Iris!" said Zeus to the
maiden messenger of heaven, "and bear this
message to Hector.  As long as he sees Agamemnon
foremost in the slaughter, let him hold back, and
leave the others to stem the tide of war; but when
Agamemnon receives a wound, as he shall do soon,
then let Hector take the lead again, and drive the
Greeks back upon their ships."
</p>

<p>
Hector duly received the message, as he was
rallying his men to defend their gates; and in
obedience to the command of Zeus he retired from
the front, and waited for the promised relief.  He
had not long to wait.  Presently Agamemnon was
assailed by Iphidamas, a son of Antenor, one of the
chief men of Troy, who charged at him, spear in
hand, and thrusting with all his force struck him
full on the breastplate.  But the spear point was
turned on the tempered metal, and Agamemnon,
seizing the shaft, dragged the weapon from his
hands, and smote down the tall champion with a
blow of his sword.  But as he was stooping to strip
the armour from the corpse, CoÃ¶n, the brother of
Iphidamas, crept up to his side, and drove his spear
clean through Agamemnon's forearm.
</p>

<p>
Though grievously hurt Agamemnon turned on
his assailant, and cut him down; and having thus
avenged himself he still fought on, dealing havoc
among the Trojans with his spear and his sword,
and with heavy stones.  But presently his blood
ceased to flow, and his arm grew stiff, as the wound
began to close.  Being now in dreadful pain, he
could fight no longer, and summoning his chariot he
left the field, and drove at full speed back to the camp.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
"Forward, men of Troy!" shouted Hector,
rushing to the front.  "Agamemnon is sorely
wounded, and Zeus has promised us the victory."  And
as a hunter cheers on his hounds against a lion
or wild boar, so Hector encouraged his Trojans, by
word and by action, to assail the Greeks; and like
a black squall which leaps suddenly on the Ã†gÃ¦an,
he himself led the assault, strong in the support of
Zeus, and confident of victory.
</p>

<p>
Diomede marked him as he moved his way
through the Grecian ranks, and stood to oppose
him, poising his spear.  The weapon flew, and
struck him on the helmet, but rebounded from the
massive brazen ridge, and dropped on the ground.
Hector, though unwounded, was hurled back by
that ponderous stroke, and sank, half-stunned, on
one knee, leaning on his hand.  Following up his
advantage, Diomede rushed forward to regain his
spear; but meanwhile Hector had recovered from
his faintness, and escaped in his chariot to the rear.
"Again thou hast avoided death at my hands, thou
dog!" shouted Diomede after him.  "But I will
slay thee yet."  And he stooped to take the armour
from a Trojan whom he had killed.
</p>

<p>
Leaning against a stone pillar, the monument of
Ilus, an ancient King of Troy, stood the gay archer
Paris; and when he saw Diomede kneeling by the
fallen Trojan he took steady aim, and launched an
arrow, which pierced through Diomede's right foot,
and pinned him to the ground.  "Thou art hit," he
cried, springing from his ambush with a loud laugh.
"Would that my shaft had cloven thy very heart!
So should I have given a breathing space to the
Trojans, who cower before thee like bleating goats
before a lion."
</p>

<p>
"Out on thee, cowardly bowman!" answered
Diomede, with scorn.  "Thou fightest thy battles
from a safe distance, and shunnest the push of
sword or spear.  And now thou art boasting aloud
over this pinprick, which harms me not at all.  There
is no force in the blow from a coward's arm.  But the
touch of my weapon means death, and they who feel
it need no second stroke.  Their last bed is the bare,
cold ground, and vultures perform their obsequies."
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding these bold words, the wound
was severe, and as soon as Odysseus, who ran to
aid his friend, had drawn out the shaft, Diomede
was obliged to retire from the battlefield.
</p>

<p>
As Odysseus was about to join the ranks of the
retreating Greeks he found himself hemmed in by
a party of Trojan spearsmen, who surrounded him
with a circle of bristling points.  Then as a wild
boar issues from his shady lair, foaming and
champing his teeth, and charges down upon the hounds
and hunters who have beset the covert, so sprang
Odysseus on his assailants, and in a moment four
of them lay writhing at his feet.  The last of these,
a young noble named Charops, found an avenger in
Socus, his brother, who thrust so vigorously at
Odysseus with his spear that the point clave
through shield and corslet, and made a long ragged
wound in his side.  Socus, in his turn, who fled as
soon as the blow was struck, was gored in the back,
between the shoulders, by the spear of Odysseus.
But that sage and valiant warrior was now in deadly
peril; for when the Trojans saw his blood flowing,
as he drew out the lance from his corslet and shield,
they fell upon him like one man, with wild cries of
triumph.  Slowly he gave back before them,
shouting aloud to his friends to come to his rescue.
Three times he cried, and his voice reached the
ears of Menelaus, who hurried to his relief,
bringing with him the mighty Ajax, son of Telamon.
</p>

<p>
They came not a moment too soon, for Odysseus
was hard beset by his clamorous foes, who crowded
round him, like jackals round a tall antlered stag
which has been wounded with an arrow, and has
fled to the shelter of the woods: but while the
jackals are yelping about him, up comes a great
bearded lion, and scatters the jackals, and makes
the stag his prey.  So when the towering form of
Ajax appeared, as he advanced with his huge orbed
shield, the Trojans abandoned their intended victim,
and fled in dismay.  Menelaus took the wounded
man by the hand, and led him to the place where
his chariot was waiting, leaving Ajax occupied with
a fresh column of Trojans, who came pouring to
the attack when they saw their friends routed.
Then mightily raged the sword of Ajax, falling like
a flail on the heads of his foes, and man and horse
went down before him.
</p>

<p>
All this time Hector had been fighting in another
part of the field, at the extreme left of the line of
battle, where the Greeks were led by Nestor and
Idomeneus.  A lucky shot from the bow of Paris
disabled Machaon, who, besides being a stout
fighter, was the most skilful leech in the Greek
army.  "We must save him at any cost," said
Idomeneus to Nestor.  "A skilful physician is
worth a whole troop of spearsmen.  Mount thou
thy car, and carry him with all speed to the
camp."  Nestor did as he was advised, and Idomeneus was
thus left to bear the brunt alone.
</p>

<p>
Just at this moment Cebriones, Hector's
charioteer, came galloping up with the news that
the main body of the Trojans was suffering severely
from the attack led by Ajax.  As the departure
of Nestor and Machaon had left him little to do in
this part of the field, Hector at once mounted his
chariot, and directed his course towards the spot
where Ajax was fighting.  Right between the
warring lines he drove, trampling over corpses,
helmets, and shields; and steeds and car were
spattered with blood.  Soon he was joined by a
strong troop of Trojan warriors, and Ajax found
himself assailed by a storm of missiles.  Then even
that mighty man felt a touch of fear, and throwing
his shield behind him he began slowly to retire,
halting at every step, and striking down some too
daring assailant.  Like a lion who has been driven
off from a herdsman's steading with javelins, and
with stones, and with burning brands, yet will not
leave the place, but prowls near all night, lusting
after the flesh of the fat beeves&mdash;so Ajax, though
hard beset, drew back reluctantly, inch by inch,
before the clamour and fury of his foes.  Dogged
he was, and hard to stir from his place, like some big
greedy ass who has found his way into a deep field
of corn, and will not budge till he has filled his
belly, though assailed by a laughing crowd of
children, who rain blows on his back and
ribs,&mdash;even so the blows rained upon Ajax, who was
encumbered by the weight of the spears which had
pierced his shield.  At last, the Greeks advanced
to his succour in close array, and joining their
ranks he wheeled once more and faced the
thronging Trojans.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The tide of battle had thus turned again, and
the Greeks were being driven steadily back upon
their camp.  The roar of the conflict reached the
ears of Achilles, who was standing near his ship,
peering out eagerly over the Trojan plain; and at
the same moment he saw Nestor driving past in his
chariot, bringing with him the wounded Machaon.
Then he called to Patroclus, and bade him go and
inquire who the injured man was.  "I think," he
added, "that it was Machaon; but the car passed
me in a flash, and I saw not his face.  Methinks
the hour of my revenge is near, for the Greeks
are in a sore strait."  Ah! son of Peleus, thy
revenge is indeed near, but thou little dreamest
how dearly thou wilt pay for that bitter morsel.
</p>

<p>
When Patroclus reached the tent of Nestor he
found the venerable King of Pylos sitting with
Machaon, waiting while a handmaid prepared for
them a slight refection.  The woman drew a table
before them, and on it she placed a brazen dish,
with onions, and honeycomb, and barley cakes.
Then she took a massive cup, embossed with gold,
resting on a double base, and having four golden
handles, each one of which was wrought in the
form of two doves, which seemed to be feeding
from the cup.  In this vessel she prepared a
posset, pouring in a rich red wine, into which she
sprinkled cheese of goats' milk and white barley
meal.  And when the posset was ready she set it
on the table, and bade them drink.
</p>

<p>
The cup was very weighty, and a strong hand
was needed to lift it to the lips; but Nestor raised
it easily, old as he was, and was about to take a
draught, when, looking up, he saw Patroclus
standing at the door of the tent.  Replacing the goblet
on the table, Nestor rose to greet him, and taking
him by the hand invited him to enter.  But
Patroclus hesitated, wishing to return at once with
the required information to his friend, whose
impatient and exacting mood he knew and feared.
"I was sent," he said, "to ask the name of the
wounded man, and I see that it is Machaon.
Achilles waits for an answer, and I dare not keep
him waiting."  Nevertheless, he lingered awhile,
and listened to the long harangue of that "old
man eloquent," who soon wandered, according to
his wont, into a long story of his youthful prowess,
when he lived as the sole survivor of twelve sons
in the house of his father Neleus.  "But why,"
he asked, when that theme was exhausted&mdash;"why
should Achilles inquire about one wounded Greek?
He knows not the extent of our mischances, nor
how much cause we have to mourn.  Diomede, the
valiant son of Tydeus, is stricken with an arrow,
Agamemnon also is wounded, and likewise
Odysseus.  Will Achilles now be satisfied, or is
he waiting until our ships are consumed with fire,
and all of us put to the sword?  Would that this
arm of mine were as of yore, when I was the
bulwark of my father's house, and of all my people.
But Achilles puts forth his might and his valour
only for his own honour and glory, and cares not
though his country perish.  Canst thou do nothing
with him?  Remember the charge which Men&oelig;tius,
thy father, gave thee, when we were sojourning, I
and Odysseus, in the house of Peleus.  We came
thither to summon thee and Achilles to the war,
and ye were both fain to go.  And these were the
parting words of Men&oelig;tius to thee: "My son,
Achilles, is far mightier than thou, but thou art the
elder, and it is for thee to guide him, and counsel
him for his good.  Be wise, and be kind, and he
will obey thee."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! take those words to heart, and reason with
that wilful youth.  If he is obeying some oracle
from Zeus, which forbids him to go into battle, at
least let him send thee to lead the Myrmidons in
his stead, and let him lend thee his armour, that the
Trojans may be affrighted when they see thee,
thinking that Achilles has arisen.  Thus, at least, we
shall get a little respite, and gain time to breathe."
</p>

<p>
Pondering deeply on the last words of Nestor,
which were to prove so fatal to himself, Patroclus
hastened back on the way to his own quarters.
But he was to be delayed a second time: for as
he was passing the tent of Odysseus he met
Eurypylus, one of the bravest of the Greeks, who
came limping towards him, being wounded in the
thigh by an arrow.  He was a pitiful sight,
begrimed with dust and sweat, and bleeding
copiously from his wound.  And Patroclus groaned
in spirit when he saw him, for he was cut to the
heart to find so many of his comrades disabled.
"Woe is me!" he said, with a glance of pity, "to
see thee thus.  But tell me, how goes the day?"
</p>

<p>
"We can keep the field no longer," answered
Eurypylus.  "The Greeks must retire behind their
barriers.  But thou seest how grievously I am hurt;
take me with thee to thy tent, and cut the arrow
out of my thigh, and when thou hast washed my
wound with warm water, lay thereon some of the
powerful simples which Achilles received from the
wise centaur, Chiron.  For of the two leeches of the
army one, Machaon, is in need of a physician himself,
and Podalirius, the other, is fighting in the front."
</p>

<p>
"I am in haste," said Patroclus, "howbeit, I
will not leave thee in this state"; and, supporting
the wounded man in his arms, he guided him
slowly to his tent, and seating him on a couch of
bulls' hides played the part of physician with such
skill and success that the blood was stanched, and
the sharp pain allayed.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
The Attack on the Grecian Camp
</p>

<p>
The Greeks were now driven back upon
their defences, and a furious struggle
ensued for the possession of the walls.  The
battle was no longer a succession of duels, such
as we have witnessed hitherto, but a desperate
contest for life and death, in which high and low,
nobles and commons, had to take their share.  As
before, Hector took the lead, and tried to force his
way across the moat, and up the steep slope on the
other side, which was topped by a wall of stone,
and a stiff fence of palisades.  Again and again
he rushed at the yawning moat in his car, but
each time his horses refused the leap, and stood
neighing and trembling, with their hoofs planted
at the brink.
</p>

<p>
At last, perceiving that he was wasting his
strength to no purpose, he changed his method of
attack, and leaving his car in charge of a squire
prepared to lead the assault on foot.  Some time
was lost while he was collecting a picked body of
men to follow him, and instructing them how to
proceed; and while he was taking his measures,
Asius, a captain of the allies, made a bold attempt
to carry the Greek position at a single blow.
Disregarding Hector's orders, he remained in his
chariot, called to his troop to keep close behind
him, and drove rapidly round the line of the wall,
looking for a weak point where he might hope
to force an entrance.  He succeeded beyond his
hopes; for on the extreme left of the camp he
found a gate which was still open to admit any
stragglers who might have been left behind in the
flight of the Greeks.  With a shout of triumph he
drove straight at the open gateway, with all his
company following pell-mell.  But just as he was
about to cross the portals he found himself
confronted by a pair of gigantic brothers, who stood
like two mighty oaks deep-rooted on a mountain
top, ready to dispute the way.  They were well
supported by the defenders who lined the walls,
and a hail of stones and javelins rattled down on
the shields of Asius and his men, who were driven
back with loss and compelled to retire out of range.
The gates were then closed and barred, and for
this time the camp was saved.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Trojans under Hector's command
were still hesitating on the brink of the moat.  For
a strange portent had occurred, which gave them
pause, just as they were rushing to the assault.
On the left hand of the army they saw an eagle
soaring high in the air, holding a huge serpent in
his talons, which writhed and struggled to escape.
And indeed the eagle had met his match, for
suddenly the serpent drew back his head, and
darting forward bit his captor in the breast.  The
eagle gave a scream of pain, and dropping the
serpent, which fell in the midst of the Trojans, flew

a strange portent had occurred, which gave them
pause, just as they were rushing to the assault.
On the left hand of the army they saw an eagle
soaring high in the air, holding a huge serpent in
his talons, which writhed and struggled to escape.
And indeed the eagle had met his match, for
suddenly the serpent drew back his head, and
darting forward bit his captor in the breast.  The
eagle gave a scream of pain, and dropping the
serpent, which fell in the midst of the Trojans, flew
swiftly away.
</p>

<p>
All stood amazed, and doubt and fear crept into
their hearts when they saw the monster writhing
at their feet.  At last Polydamas, a warrior who
was famed for his skill in augury, turned to Hector,
and said: "My prince, the sign is against us; and
as the eagle was stricken, when he strove to carry
the dappled snake to his young, so shall we also
be stricken, if we persist in our assault on the
Grecian stronghold.  Let us draw off our men,
lest we be found fighting against the gods, and
bring upon ourselves rout and disaster."
</p>

<p>
"Polydamas," answered Hector, with bended
brows, "if thou hast no better counsel than this
thou hadst better hold thy peace, for the gods have
marred thy wit.  Vain man! knowest thou not that
we came hither under a sure promise from Zeus?
Are we to obey his voice, or shall we be cowed by
the flapping of a wing?  What care I for any fowl
that flies east or west, while I stand under the
favour of heaven's high lord?  To the patriot all
omens are good, when his country summons him
to her defence.  A truce to thine idle prate!  Thou
hast naught to fear, whether we fight or fly, for
thou art never seen on the perilous edge of battle.
But keep thy cold counsels for thine own coward
heart, or I will find means to lock thy lips for ever."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon he sprang forward towards the wall,
and all his men followed, raising a deafening shout.
And from the glens of Ida there came a rushing
mighty wind, which bore a blinding cloud of dust
into the faces of the Greeks, and hindered them in
the work of defence.  The Trojans had now crossed
the moat, and were striving with all their force to
break down the wall.  Some tugged at the battlements,
and tried to pull them down, while others
brought levers to overthrow the projecting
buttresses.  On the other side the Greeks fought
stubbornly, making a fence with their shields along
the line of the wall, and keeping up a shower of
javelins and stones.
</p>

<p><a id="p107"></a></p>

<p>
Foremost in the defence were the greater and
lesser Ajax, who hurried up and down the
battlements, encouraging, rebuking, and threatening.
"Stand fast!" they cried.  "This is no time for
flinching.  Let every man do his part, whether he
be weak or strong.  Your lives are in your own
hands."
</p>

<p>
As on a winter day, when Zeus has lulled the
winds to sleep, and all the air is thick with flying
snowflakes, until mountain top and jutting
promontory, green field and black ploughland, level
shore and rocky bay, are all hidden under the same
dazzling mantle, whose fringe touches the cold,
grey sea&mdash;so thick flew the missiles on either side,
rattling down uninterruptedly on battlement and
helmet and shield.
</p>

<p>
Conspicuous among the allies of the Trojans were
Glaucus and Sarpedon, the leaders of the Lycians.
They were bosom friends, of one heart and one
mind; and the night before they had discoursed
earnestly together on the duties and privileges of
their rank.  The words of Sarpedon on this
occasion are ever memorable.  "I need not tell thee,
Glaucus," he said, "why we twain are honoured
above all the rest with the highest seats, the
costliest fare, and cups ever full, and why a fair
domain of corn-land and olive ground and vineyard
was set apart for us on the banks of Xanthus.
As we have received freely, so freely must we give,
sparing not even our heart's blood in the service
of those to whom we owe all we have.  Let us be
no sluggard kings, first in the feast and last in the
fray, but, as we are foremost in privilege, so let us
be foremost in peril.  Man walketh as a vain
shadow, and all his steps are encompassed by
death; die he must, ere many days are passed&mdash;herein
he hath no choice&mdash;but, unless he hath the
soul of a slave, he will choose death with honour."
</p>

<p>
Acting in the spirit of these noble words, Sarpedon,
with Glaucus at his side, and all the chivalry
of Lycia at his back, now made a determined
attack on the part of the wall where Menestheus,
the captain of the Athenians, was directing the
defence.  Menestheus, feeling that he was ill
provided to sustain the onset of these two famous
captains, raised his voice to summon Ajax to his
succour; but his cry was drowned by the
tremendous din of the battle which was raging around
him, and the thundering blows which the Trojans
were now raining upon the gates.  So he sent an
urgent message by a herald, begging Ajax to come
to his relief.  Ajax responded promptly to the call,
and joined the men under Menestheus, bringing
with him Teucer, his half-brother, who was now
sufficiently recovered from his wound to take part
in the defence.
</p>

<p>
On came the storming party, with Sarpedon at
their head, and they were already beginning to
swarm up the battlements, when the arrival of
Teucer and Ajax gave them a check.  Lifting up a
ponderous stone, which he found lying loose by the
wall, Ajax dashed out the brains of a stout Lycian,
whose knee was already on the rampart, and down
he toppled, plunging headforemost, like a diver,
into the moat; and at the same moment a lucky
shot from Teucer's bow struck Glaucus in the arm.
Incensed to see his comrade wounded, Sarpedon
redoubled his efforts, and grasping one of the
battlements with both hands he wrenched it from its
place, and sent it crashing to the ground.  But,
being fiercely attacked by Ajax and Teucer
together, he was compelled to draw back a little,
and wait for support.  "On, Lycians!" he shouted.
"Why loiter ye behind?  I cannot win the wall
alone."
</p>

<p>
The Lycians rallied to the voice of their prince,
and the battle was renewed with fresh fury on both
sides.  Up the steep bank they swarmed again,
and strove with all their might to drive back the
defenders from their battlements.  But the Greeks
would not yield an inch, and besiegers and besieged
held their ground stubbornly in that grim
controversy, like two farmers who stand, with
measuring-lines in their hands, disputing hotly about a few
inches of ground, on the boundaries of their
fields&mdash;or like an honest labouring woman, who holds
the scale in even balance, weighing the wool which
she has spun to win a scanty wage wherewith to
buy her children bread.[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]  So in even balance hung
the fray, and many were the wounds given and
received in back or in breast, until the battlements
ran with blood.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn1text">1</a>] The yarn is weighed to show that none of the raw
wool has been stolen.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But the chief honour of the day was reserved for
Hector, who was the first to set foot within the
fortress of the Greeks.  While the battle was still
raging on the wall, he made his way to the main
entrance of the camp, which was defended by stout
oaken gates, fast closed with massy bolt and bar.
In front of the gates lay a huge stone, such as two
men could hardly lift in these less heroic days.
Lifting the mighty boulder, he carried it, easily as
a shepherd carries a fleece, close up to the gates.
Then, planting his feet firmly, he heaved that
ponderous mass above his head, and flung.  Like
a thunderbolt flew the enormous missile, dashing
through panel and bolt and bar.  The gates, torn
from their hinges, fell inward, and over the ruins
sprang Hector, with brow black as night, and death
in his glance.  Terribly gleamed his brazen armour
as he leapt upon the foe, with a lance in each hand.
None save the gods could have dared to face him
in that hour of triumph and victory.  The Trojans
poured in behind him, or leapt down from the wall,
now deserted by the panic-stricken Greeks, who fled
with one accord to the shelter of their ships.
</p>

<h3>
Poseidon aids the Greeks
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The promise which Zeus had made to
Thetis seemed now on the point of being
fulfilled, and accordingly Zeus, by whose
direct interference alone the Trojans had been able
to work such havoc among the Greeks, relaxed
his attention, and left the rival armies to fight out
the issue between them, never dreaming that any
of the gods would venture to act against his
express command.
</p>

<p>
But Poseidon, his brother, and second only to
Zeus himself in power, was a staunch ally of the
Greeks, and was bitterly indignant that they should
suffer defeat at the hands of the hated and despised
Trojans.  As long as the eye of Zeus was on the
battlefield he dared not interfere; but as soon as
he saw his great brother engaged elsewhere he left
his seat on the island of Samothrace, where he
had been overlooking the battle, and sped on his
way to Ã†gÃ¦, his sacred city on the shores of the
Gulf of Corinth.  The mountains bowed their
heads, and the trees vailed[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>] their high tops,
beneath the immortal feet of Poseidon, the King.  In
three steps he reached his goal, and entered his
shining, golden palace, built in the cool depths of
that glassy bay.  There he bade harness his brazen-footed
steeds, and mounting the car drove it across
the waters.  The charmed billows parted to make
him a path, and round him played the dolphins,
and other huge children of the deep, as his wheels
passed unwetted over that heaving, liquid floor.
So on they bounded, until they reached the shores
of Troy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Greeks were still flying before the victorious
Trojans, who pressed them hard, with furious
uproar, when suddenly there appeared among them
one like unto Calchas, the prophet, in form and in
voice.  "Take heart, comrades!" said he, addressing
himself to Ajax, who, with his namesake, was
still heading the defence; "we shall beat them yet,
if only we can quench the fury of that madman,
Hector, who bears himself like a son of Zeus.
Have at them, and thrust them back from the ships!"
</p>

<p>
His words were common, but they were uttered
by a god, and breathed a mysterious influence,
which was aided by a light touch from the staff
which he bore.  Instantly a strange lightness and
vigour entered into their limbs, and when the
pretended Calchas vanished as abruptly as he came,
they knew that the words which they had heard
were spoken by no mortal lips.
</p>

<p>
Without pausing for a moment, Poseidon
continued the work which he had begun.  From rank
to rank, from leader to leader, he flew, inspiring,
encouraging, entreating; and wherever he passed
a new fire was kindled in every breast, so that they
who but a moment before had given up all for lost
now thought with shame of their faintheartedness,
and rallied to the call of their leaders, resolved to
conquer or die.
</p>

<p>
Where Ajax and his namesake fought were
mustered the choicest troops in the Greek army.
Shoulder to shoulder, and knee to knee, they stood,
making a firm fence with shield overlapping shield,
and bristling with a forest of spears.  "Stand fast!"
shouted Ajax, as Hector came on with headlong
rush, like some huge rock, which hangs threatening
on a steep mountain-side, until it is undermined by
a winter torrent, and thunders down the slope
until it has spent its force and lies motionless on
the plain.  So Hector hurled himself with fury
against the solid phalanx of the Greeks, but spent
his fury in vain on that hedge of iron, and could
not break through it, for all his rage.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Idomeneus, the leader of the Cretans, had been
absent some time from the battle, attending to a
wounded comrade, and when he left him he went to
his tent, to replace part of his armour, which had
been damaged in the fight.  On reaching his
quarters he was met by Meriones, his second in
command, who had gone to fetch a fresh spear,
having broken his own on a Trojan shield.
"What doest thou here, Meriones?" he asked.
"Art thou wounded, or bringest thou some message
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I came to fetch a spear," answered Meriones;
"my own was broken in the fight."  "Spears there
are in plenty in my tent," said Idomeneus, "and
helmets, and shields, and burnished corslets&mdash;the
spoils of many a vanquished Trojan."  "And in
mine too there is no lack of such," replied Meriones.
"But thy tent was nearer.  Thou knowest best
whether I do my devoir on the field of honour or not."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen thee prove thy manly worth," said
Idomeneus.  "Thou needst not remind me.  I
have noted thy bearing in the long cold hours of
the night, when thou wast one of a picked company
lying in ambush, and waiting for the dawn.  This
is the sternest, sharpest test of valour and
endurance.  Mark then the coward, how he flushes,
and then pales, shifting uneasily from one foot
to another, as he cowers in his place, with
chattering teeth and wildly beating heart, and mark the
hero, crouched, like a good hound, motionless and
silent, ready to spring at his enemy's throat.  None
ever passed through that sharp ordeal with more
honour than thou.  And in open battle thy face
is ever to the foe, and thy scars are all in front.
But enough of this: here stand we bragging of
our prowess, while our comrades are encompassed
by the flames of war.  Let us away, and show our
manhood by deeds, not words."
</p>

<p>
Like murderous Ares when he arms him for
battle in the savage land of Thrace, and by his
side goes Terror, his son, whose fierce eyes appal
the stoutest heart, so rushed Idomeneus back to
the field, with Meriones, his trusty friend.  "Let us
make for the left of the fighting line," cried
Idomeneus.  "On the right the Trojans are weaker, and
in the centre fights Telamonian Ajax, a pillar of
strength, the equal of Achilles in all save speed of
foot.  On the left the need is sorest, with most
room for a leader of note."
</p>

<p>
As on a wild and gusty day, when two clouds
of dust are whirled together by conflicting winds,
so met the Greek and Trojan columns, with clash
of shield and glitter of spear, when Idomeneus and
his comrade returned to the field.  Not in vain had
Idomeneus boasted of his deeds of war.  Many a
Trojan went down that day before his spear; and
the first of them was Othryoneus, who was lately
come to Troy, and was a suitor for the hand of
Cassandra, the fairest of Priam's daughters.  Great
was the price which he had promised to pay for his
bride.  "Give me thy daughter," he said, "and I
will drive these Greeks out of the land."  But the
lance of Idomeneus cut short his wooing, and down
he fell with a sounding crash.  "Is it thou, gallant
bridegroom?" shouted Idomeneus, as his helmet
fell off, exposing his face.  "How wilt thou keep thy
bargain with Priam now?  That wager is lost, but
come with me, and we will find thee a fair partner
yet.  Thou shalt have the fairest of Agamemnon's
daughters, if thou wilt aid us to sack the stately
city of Troy.  How likest thou the terms?"
</p>

<p>
Thus insulting his fallen foe, Idomeneus began
to drag him away by the foot, intending to spoil
him of his armour.  While thus employed, he was
confronted by Asius, who came on foot against him,
his squire following close with the chariot, so that
he felt the hot breath of the horses on his shoulders.
But Idomeneus was too quick for him, and pierced
him, as he stood with weapon poised, in the throat,
driving the point clean through his neck.  Like
an oak, or poplar, or tall pine, hewn down on a
mountainside to make a ship's timber, so fell that
proud champion, and lay in his blood at his horse's
feet, moaning and clutching at the dust.  The
charioteer was dumfoundered by his master's fall,
and dropped the reins in his terror; and while he
stood thus, with staring eyes and gaping mouth,
Antilochus thrust him through with his spear, and
leaping into the car drove off with his prize.
</p>

<p>
Idomeneus was now fiercely assailed by a
formidable antagonist, in the person of Deiphobus,
a brother of Hector, and one of the bravest of the
Trojans.  Idomeneus crouched low as he saw him
coming with brandished spear; and the weapon
passed over him, just grazing the rim of his shield,
but found a victim in another Greek, who was
advancing to his support, and received the point
in his breast.  Down he went, and Deiphobus
cried exultingly: "Not unavenged falls Asius, but
I have given him a companion on his journey to
the shades."
</p>

<p>
Thus saved from his peril, the stout old Cretan
glared about him, looking for another mark for his
spear; and he found one in the young Alcathous,
who was married to a daughter of Anchises, and
was thus closely related to Ã†neas.  The youthful
prince, being new to the work of war, was
bewildered by the roar and tumult of the struggle
which was raging around him, and stood,
overpowered by sudden panic, within close range of
the Cretan captain's lance.  "Sleepest thou, pretty
lad!" shouted the grim veteran, "I will wake thee
from thy slumber."  And he clove him through the
breast with his spear, which stilled the last beatings
of his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Three Trojans for one Greek!" shouted
Idomeneus.  "Art thou content, Deiphobus?  Come
hither, and I will add a fourth.  It will be glory
enough for thee to die by the hand of Idomeneus,
whose grandsire was Minos, the very son of Zeus."
</p>

<p>
Deiphobus deemed it prudent to decline the
challenge, and he went in search of Ã†neas, to
inform him of his kinsman's fall.  Ã†neas was
loitering in the rear, for he had a grudge against
Priam, which chilled his ardour for the battle.
But when he heard that Alcathous was slain his
heart burned to avenge him, and he hurried to the
front, where he was joined by Paris and a strong
band of Trojans.  Idomeneus, on his part, was
reinforced by the arrival of Meriones, Antilochus,
and Ascalaphus, a son of Ares, with their followers;
and so the fight raged on, and many a stout warrior
went down to swell the muster-roll of death.
</p>

<p>
There fought Helenus, the prophetic son of
Priam, armed with bow and arrows, and wielding
a mighty falchion, tempered in a Thracian forge.
With one blow of that trenchant blade he shattered
the helmet of a Greek warrior, a friend of Menelaus,
and laid him at his feet, stunned and bleeding.
Menelaus sprang to his friend's relief, and flung
his spear at Helenus; and at the same moment
Helenus shot an arrow, which struck the prince on
the breastplate, but rebounded as beans or pulse
rebound from the winnower's shovel, while the spear
of Menelaus pierced him through the left hand,
pinning it to the bow.  Helenus retired, trailing
the spear after him, until a comrade drew it out, and
bound up the wounded hand with a woollen sling,
which he took from his squire.
</p>

<p>
Menelaus was now attacked by another Trojan
chieftain, who, after making an abortive thrust with
his spear, took in his hand an axe, which hung
inside his shield, and, swinging the weapon over
his head by its long shaft of olive-wood, leapt upon
him with a fierce cry.  But before the blow could
descend he received a fearful wound in the
forehead, from the sword of the Spartan king, and fell
backwards in the dust.  "So may all the Trojans
perish!" cried Menelaus, setting his foot on the
breast of his prostrate foe.  "Ye have robbed me
of my wife; ye have plundered my treasure, after
receiving generous welcome under my roof.  And
now ye come hither to burn our fleet, and butcher
us in our camp.  Great sire of heaven, men praise
thy righteousness, and call thee wise above all gods
and men: how then canst thou lend thy countenance
to these bloodthirsty robbers, whose pastime is
murder, whose joy is to betray?"
</p>

<br />
Menelaus.  Vatican, Rome
</p>

<p>
Carried away by his eloquence, Menelaus failed
to observe that he was threatened by a new
assailant.  This was Harpalion, son of the King
of Paphlagonia, who charged at him, lance in hand.
Menelaus was just in time to receive the blow on
his shield, and before Harpalion could recover his
weapon he was transfixed by the spear of Meriones,
and lay writhing like a worm on the ground, until
he was borne, groaning, from the field by his
attendants, followed by his weeping father.
</p>

<p>
Paris was wroth at the fall of the Paphlagonian
prince, who was his friend and guest, and he drew
his bow at a venture, and slew Euchenor, the son
of a famous seer, who dwelt in Corinth.  Often his
father had prophesied to him that he was destined
to die either by a wasting disease, or on the
battlefield at Troy.  He chose a warrior's death, and
found it on that day, by the hand of Paris.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
In the other part of the camp, near the main
gate, where Hector had first effected an entrance,
the Greeks were still fighting with indomitable
spirit under Telamonian Ajax, and his namesake,
the son of Oileus.  These two held together, and
battled side by side, like two stout oxen yoked to
the same plough, and toiling from dawn till sunset,
while the sweat streams without ceasing from the
roots of their horns: so stood they side by side,
and bore the brunt, all through that long and bitter
fray.  And behind them were arrayed the bowmen
and slingers of Locris, whose captain was the lesser
Ajax, and kept up such a shower of arrows and
leaden bullets that the Trojans at length began
to waver, and broke their ranks.
</p>

<p>
When Polydamas, the wisest head among the
Trojans, saw that the great assault, which had
begun so boldly, was beginning to flag, he called
Hector aside, and said to him: "Hector, thou art
strong of hand, but weak of head.  Seest thou not
that we are wasting our valour, by fighting thus in
scattered parties, with no settled plan of attack?
Now, hearken to me, and do as I shall say, if thou
wouldst not have us driven back in shameful rout
upon the town.  Gather all our parties into one
strong phalanx, and charge with them all at once
on one point in the Grecian line.  Thus, and thus
only, may we hope to prevail, outnumbered as we
are by two to one."
</p>

<p>
Hector saw that the advice was good, and,
leaving Polydamas to hold the Greeks in check, he
went in search of Asius, Deiphobus, and the rest,
who were fighting on the left.  Sore were the gaps
which now appeared in that gallant company, and
many a hero, whom he called by name, was lying
cold in death.  Gathering such as remained, he
formed them into one body with those whom he
had left in the charge of Deiphobus, and with
the powerful column thus formed made repeated
charges, which were sustained with undaunted
firmness by Ajax and his men.
</p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
Zeus is beguiled by Hera
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
While the battle swayed to and fro, and
the Greeks were enabled by Poseidon's
aid to hold their own against the Trojans,
Zeus was sitting on a lonely peak of Ida, wrapped
in a high celestial reverie.  Hera saw the uxorious
king from her place of outlook on Olympus, and,
noting his abstracted mood, she resolved to play
him a trick.  So she went to her chamber, which
her son HephÃ¦stus had made for her, and opened
the door with a private key, which she always kept
by her, so that none might invade her apartment
in her absence.  Having locked herself in, she
began to make her toilet with peculiar care.  First,
she washed her person with ambrosia, and anointed
herself with a fragrant oil, so rich and rare that,
when she lifted the lid of the casket in which it was
stored, a divine perfume filled earth and heaven
with sweetness.  Then she dressed her lustrous hair,
and put on a wondrous robe, which Athene's own
hands had wrought for her, clasping it to her
bosom with golden brooches.  A rich girdle
confined her robe at the waist, and in her ears she
hung earrings of costly pearl; and when she had
put on her sandals, and thrown a glittering
veil over her head, she went forth smiling in
triumphant beauty, like a bride adorned for her
husband.
</p>

<p>
Having thus prepared the whole battery of her
charms, she went in search of Aphrodite, and when
she had found her she drew her apart from the
other gods, and said: "Wilt thou grant me a
boon, dear child, or wilt thou deny me in anger,
because I favour thine enemies, the Greeks?"  "Name
thy request, great queen of heaven,"
answered Aphrodite, "and I will grant it, if I can."
</p>

<p>
Concealing her real purpose, the cunning Hera
replied: "I am bound on a journey to the ends
of the earth, to visit the ancient deity Oceanus, and
Tethys, his wife, who have long been parted by a
bitter quarrel.  If I can bring them together in love
and kindness I shall do a good deed, and repay
part of the great debt of gratitude which I owe
them.  Therefore, lend me, I pray thee, the mighty
talisman which thou hast, whereof neither man nor
god can resist the powerful spell."
</p>

<p>
"It becomes me not," answered Aphrodite, "to
deny thee in this, for thou art the consort of high
Jove."  And therewith she took from her bosom an
amulet, in which there was a mysterious virtue,
able to soften the hardest heart, and turn it to
thoughts of love and tenderness.  There dwelt
persuasion and sweet endearment, the eloquence of
silence and the witchery of sighs.  "Take it," she
said, "and hide it in the folds of thy robe.  Armed
with this, thou wilt accomplish all thy desire."
</p>

<p>
Hera smiled her thanks, and taking the amulet
sped away on her errand, which carried her, not, as
she had pretended, to the distant dwelling of Oceanus,
but to Lemnos, the Ã†gÃ¦an isle, the home of sleep.
Arrived there, she sought out the drowsy god, and
found him nodding in his shadowy cave.  "Monarch
of men and gods," she began, "Immortal Sleep, thou
hast done me good service in the past, and I think
thou wilt not fail me now.  I would have thee lock
fast the eyes of Zeus in slumber deep and long.
Ask me not why, but do it, and I will give thee a
golden throne, wrought, with a footstool, by
HephÃ¦stus, my son, whereon thou mayest sit in state
like the Olympian king himself."
</p>

<p>
"Ask me aught else," answered Sleep, lifting his
heavy eyes with a look of fear, "only ask me not
to lay Zeus in slumber against his will.  Hast thou
forgotten what wild work he made when, at thy
entreaty, I shed my power upon him, and lulled his
wits in a deep trance, that thou mightest wreak thy
malice on his favourite, Heracles?  Then didst thou
raise a storm, which drove Heracles far out of his
course, when he was on his voyage from Troy.  But
when thy lord awoke, and saw what thou hadst done,
he fell to buffeting all the gods in Olympus, who
had hidden me from his sight.  And soon they
must have delivered me to his vengeance, and I
should have been undone, but an ancient and
venerable deity, even Night herself, came to my
aid, and besought him to pardon me; and so he
did, for he would not offend the august goddess,
primeval Night."
</p>

<p>
"Go to," said Hera.  "This is a far smaller thing
than that of which thou speakest.  All I desire is
an hour of respite for mine afflicted Greeks.  Come,
do as I bid thee, and thou shalt have PasiphaÃ«, one
of the Graces, for thy wife, and so fulfil the dearest
of thy desires."
</p>

<p>
Then Sleep was glad, and answering said:
"Swear to me, by the inviolable waters of Styx&mdash;placing
one hand on the earth, and the other on the
sea, that all the nether gods may be our
witnesses&mdash;swear that thou wilt give me PasiphaÃ« for my
bride."
</p>

<p>
Hera took the oath required, calling by name all
the Titans that dwell in Tartarus.  Then together
they flew across the sea to Troyland, and paused
not till they reached the wooded hills of Ida.
Upwards then they soared, over the forest-clad slopes,
and there was the sound of a going in the tree tops
as they passed.  And when they came to the peak
where Zeus was sitting, Sleep disguised himself in
the form of a swift, and hid himself in the branches
of a tall fir-tree.  But Hera went and stood in the
presence of her lord.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the god saw her he was struck with
wonder at her surpassing beauty, and his heart
overflowed with tenderness, as in the old days
when first he made her his bride.  And the little
swift shot down from the tree, and come flitting
round the monarch's head.  "Dear lady of my love,"
said he, "sit down by me awhile, and let us hold
sweet converse together."  So down she sat by his
side, and took his hand, and beguiled him with her
false blandishments.  Like two simple lovers they
seemed, caught in sly Cupid's silver net&mdash;he the
sovereign of earth and heaven, and she, his
imperious queen.  And swiftly the subtle influence of
Sleep came over him, and down he sank
overpowered, couched on a soft bed of crocus and
hyacinth and violet, which the earth put forth to
bear up his sacred person; and on him rested a
canopy of golden cloud, that he might slumber
unobserved.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Safe now from the observation of Zeus, Hera
descended swiftly to bear the news to Poseidon,
and urge him to redouble his efforts on behalf of
the Greeks.  Having brought her message, she
returned to Ida, and remained watching by the side
of Zeus, ready to give warning when he awoke.
</p>

<p>
Poseidon was not slow to seize the occasion thus
offered.  Suddenly, as the Greeks were preparing
to receive a furious charge from the enemy, there
appeared in their van a gigantic warrior, clad from
head to foot in mail of proof, and wielding a sword
which flashed and burned with an awful light.  "On,
Greeks, on!" he shouted; and his voice was as the
sound of many waters.  "Down with them, even
unto the ground, that Hector may know that there
is more than one Achilles among us."  And the
two armies met, with a crash which was echoed by
all the caverns of Ida, and recoiled again, each solid
phalanx reeling from that tremendous shock.
</p>

<p>
Into the space thus left sprang Hector, and
hurled his spear at Ajax, who was stepping forth to
meet him.  The weapon struck him on the breast,
just at the point where the shield strap, heavily
studded with metal, was crossed by the baldric of
his sword; and this double barrier, backed by the
corslet, proved an effectual defence.  Hector fell
back, vexed at his ill-fortune, and, as he was retiring,
Ajax picked up one of the stones which were lying
around, to serve as props for the ships, and flinging
it struck him on the back of the neck, just above
the rim of his shield.  It was no maiden's hand
which had aimed that blow, and Hector was sent
spinning like a top.  And as an oak reels and
staggers when struck by the bolt of Zeus, and
topples headlong to earth, a blackened and shattered
trunk, so fell the mighty Hector, crushed under the
weight of his shield, which was pressed down upon
him by the ponderous stone.
</p>

<p>
When they saw him fall, the Greeks rushed
forward, hoping to make him their prisoner.  But
the bravest of the Trojans and their allies&mdash;Sarpedon,
Ã†neas, Glaucus, and Polydamas&mdash;interposed
their shields, giving time for the others to
lift him up and carry him to the place where his
car and horses were waiting.  Carefully they placed
his senseless body on the chariot, and drove him
towards the city, until they came to the ford of
Scamander.  There they halted, and, laying him
on the bank, dashed water in his face.  Presently he
looked up, and leaning forward on his hands began
to vomit blood.  Then darkness came over his eyes,
and he fell back again in a swoon.
</p>

<p>
Now that Hector was down, the Trojans had no
course left to them but to retreat.  They still
fought valiantly, and the Greeks had to pay dear
for their success.  But slowly and surely they were
being driven back from the camp.
</p>

<h3>
The Last Battle by the Ships
</h3>

<p>
Hera was watching the action with such
eagerness that she had forgotten her
charge, and was startled by the angry
voice of Zeus, who had awakened suddenly, and
was looking down upon her with lowering brows.
"This is thy work," he said sternly, pointing to
the Trojan plain, where Hector lay senseless, and
his comrades were beginning to fly.  "Wilt thou
never be schooled to obedience, or what harder
lesson lackest thou yet?  Dost thou remember
the time when I hung thee in chains in the cold
vault of ether, with two anvils at thy feet, and all
the gods together were powerless to relieve thee?
This was thy reward for thy evil devices against
my son, Heracles; but that shall be mirth and
laughter compared with the rod which thou shall
feel if thou cease not from thy mutiny against my
sovereign will."
</p>

<p>
Then Hera was sore afraid, and she answered
submissively: "I swear by earth and heaven, and
by the down-falling waters of Styx, the greatest
and most awful thing by which a god may swear&mdash;yea,
by thy sacred head I swear it, and by the holy
bond which unites us&mdash;it was not by my devices
that Poseidon first began to aid the Greeks, but he
was led thereto by the thoughts of his own heart.
And, by my advice, he will give way to thee."
</p>

<p>
Somewhat appeased by her humility, Zeus
replied: "If that be so, and thou art willing to
heal the mischief thou hast done, go and send
hither Iris and Apollo, that they may receive my
commands.  And understand me once for all&mdash;I
will not cease from my rage and my fury against
the Greeks, nor suffer any of the gods to aid them,
until the vengeance of Pelides is accomplished, and
the oath fulfilled which I sware unto his mother,
Thetis, when she touched my knees and besought
me to honour her son."
</p>

<p>
Swift as is the glance of the mind when some
great traveller revolves all his wanderings in
thought, and murmurs to himself: "Would that I
were in this place or that!" naming some distant
scene which he hath visited, so swiftly flew Hera
with her lord's message.  When she reached
Olympus she found all the gods seated together,
drinking their nectar from golden cups.  Smiling
with her lips, but bending her dark brows in a
gloomy frown, she said, as she eyed that festal
gathering: "Ye are making good cheer, I see!
And ye will be cheered the more when I tell you
what Zeus intends.  Ay, drink deep!" she
continued, turning to Ares, who was just draining a
full cup, "thou hast need of comfort, for thy son is
slain."  And she named a Greek, Ascalaphus, son
of Ares, who had been slain by Deiphobus in the
battle.
</p>

<p>
When he heard that, the god of war groaned
with grief and anger, and crying: "I will avenge
him!" rushed to seize his arms.  But Athene
hastened after him, and finding him already
equipped for battle she snatched the spear from
his hand, and took the helmet from his head,
saying: "Madman, wilt thou undo us all?  Go
back to thy place, lest the wrath of Zeus descend
upon the whole company of the gods, and on thee
the first.  Better men have fallen than this son of
thine, and we must look to our own safety, and
leave mortals to their fate."
</p>

<p>
While Athene was occupied in restraining the
frenzy of Ares, Hera despatched Iris and Apollo
to receive the commands of Zeus.  So they went
forthwith to Ida, and found Zeus sitting in the
place where he had slept, with the golden cloud
still hanging above his head.  Zeus was well
content that his wilful consort had been so prompt in
his business, and he commanded Iris to go down to
the fleet, and warn Poseidon to leave the battlefield.
"And thus and thus shalt thou say unto
him," added Zeus, instructing her in the very
words which she was to use.
</p>

<p>
Iris descended to earth, walking delicately along
her rainbow bridge, and, having found Poseidon
among the warring Greeks, she said to him: "Thus
saith Zeus, our sovereign lord and king: 'Let
Poseidon leave the battlefield, and depart to Olympus,
or to his own watery realm.  And if he will not
obey me I will come myself, and fight against him,
face to face.  Let him avoid my hands, for he
knoweth that I am far mightier than he, and
higher in station and in dignity.'"
</p>

<p>
"What!" answered Poseidon, swelling with
injured pride.  "Am I my brother's slave, that he
sends me this haughty summons?  I am no subject
of his, but his peer, holding a third part in our
divided empire.  For three sons were born unto
Cronos&mdash;Zeus and Hades and myself.  And when
Cronos ceased to reign we cast lots between us,
and Zeus obtained the throne of heaven, I of the
sea, and Hades of the underworld; but the earth,
and wide Olympus, were left common to us all.
Therefore I bid him keep to his own domain, and
not meddle with me, for I will not live under his
laws, nor bow to his rod, which he may keep for
his sons and daughters."
</p>

<p>
"Is this, then, the answer which I must carry
back to Zeus?" asked Iris gravely.  "Oh, reflect
a little!  Enter not into an unnatural feud with
thine elder brother."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis wisely said," replied Poseidon.  "Thou art
a discreet messenger, and knowest how to season
thy words with courtesy.  'Twere ill, as thou
sayest, to stir up the demon of domestic strife
among us.  Therefore I will depart, and leave him
to work his will.  But, since he has used threats,
let him hear this from me: if he seeks to avert the
doom of Troy, he will find a cold welcome when
he joins the circle of the gods in Olympus."
</p>

<p>
It was not without relief that Zeus heard of
Poseidon's submission; for he had feared that he
would be obliged to engage in a fearful struggle,
which would have confounded earth and heaven.
This danger being removed, he sent Apollo, armed
with his own shield&mdash;the awful Ã¦gis, clothed with
attributes of terror&mdash;commanding him to heal
Hector of his hurt, and bring him back to battle.
Like a falcon stooping on his quarry, Apollo shot
down from Ida's peak, and alighted at the ford
of Scamander, where Hector was still lying.  By
this time the stricken man had recovered from
his swoon, and was gazing in bewilderment around him.
</p>

<p>
One touch from that potent hand, one word from
those immortal lips, sufficed to banish all the effects
of the fearful blow which had left Hector as weak
as a child.  Bounding to his feet, he cried: "Lead
on, mighty god!  I fear no perils with thee at my
side," and like a gallant war horse, that smelleth
the battle afar off, he ran at full speed to rejoin the
Trojans, who were now flying tumultuously from
the camp.  And as when a troop of hunters with
their hounds have started a royal stag, and chased
him with wild halloo to the thick covert of a tangled
wood; then suddenly they shrink back with cries
of dismay, for they see a lion standing in the path:
so panic fell upon the Greeks in the midst of their
triumph, when they saw Hector returning to battle,
full of vigour and courage, though they had already
counted him among the dead.
</p>

<p>
On poured the Trojans, Hector and Apollo
leading the van, and the Greeks gave ground
before them, scared by the dread Ã¦gis, which Apollo
shook in their faces, crying his terrible cry.  At
first they yielded slowly, keeping their ranks, and
attempting some defence; but soon the retreat
became a rout, and the moat was filled with a
struggling multitude, seeking the shelter of the
wall and the ships.  "Kill, kill!" cried Hector
fiercely.  "Pause not to strip the dead, but slay the
men, and burn their ships.  Let me but see
anyone skulking behind for plunder and he dies by my
hand."
</p>

<p>
With that he lashed his horses, and drove straight
across the moat, the Trojans following him in dense
column.  In front strode Apollo, trampling down
the sides of the moat as he went, and making a
path broad as the farthest cast of a spear.  Then
he hurled himself on the wall, and overthrew it,
as easily as a child destroys with his feet a castle of
sand which he has raised in sport on the margin
of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Like a towering billow, which topples down upon
a ship, crushing her bulwarks and flooding her
with brine, so rushed the Trojans in a torrent over
the wall, and fell upon the hindmost row of ships;
and the Greeks on their side mounted the decks,
and thrust at their assailants with long boarding-pikes,
which lay ready to hand.
</p>

<p>
Foremost among the defenders was seen the
giant form of Telamonian Ajax; and by his side
fought Teucer, whose bow had already done such
good service to the Greeks.  But just as Teucer
was aiming an arrow at Hector his bowstring
snapped, and the arrow dropped harmless to the
ground.  "Fate is against us to-day," he cried;
"it was a new string, the stoutest and the best
I had, which I fitted to my bow this very morning."
</p>

<p>
"Go quickly," answered Ajax.  "And arm thyself
with shield and spear; there is no room here
for thine archery to-day."  And Teucer went and
armed himself, and returned with all speed to his
mighty brother's side.
</p>

<p>
Hector was overjoyed when he saw Teucer's
mishap, which he hailed as the direct act of Zeus
himself.  "On, Trojans!" he shouted; "on, ye men
of Lycia!  Zeus is fighting on our side.  Now is the
great day of vengeance, after all the weary years
when we were penned within our walls like sheep."
</p>

<p>
"Why flinch ye?" cried Ajax, in his turn, to the
Greeks.  "Know ye not that we must conquer or
die to-day?  Or will we reach home on foot, if ye
suffer your ships to be burned?  Come, join the
wild dance to which Hector summons us.  Fight,
and we will drive out this rabble yet; but if ye
falter we shall surely perish."
</p>

<p>
Again the Greeks rallied to the well-known voice
of Ajax, and drew up in close order before the ships,
barring Hector's way.  But the finger of Apollo
had touched him, filling his breast with a divine
frenzy.  Foaming and glaring with rage, he flung
himself on the solid phalanx, and cut down a tall
champion of MycenÃ¦, making a gap in the line.
Before the Greeks could close their ranks the
Trojans were among them, hewing them down as
a woodman hews a path through the forest.
Forward and still forward they pressed, driving the
Greeks before them, and compelling them to retire
from the first line of ships.
</p>

<p>
Then nothing but the tremendous valour of Ajax
could have saved the Greek army from total rout
and ruin.  Active as a panther, in spite of his huge
bulk, he sprang from deck to deck, wielding an
enormous boarding-pike and striking down the
Trojans, as they advanced with lighted torches to
set fire to the ships.  Like a practised rider, who
yokes together four horses, and drives them at a
gallop along a level highroad, leaping from one
steed to another as he goes&mdash;so Ajax shifted his
ground from one ship to another, dashing down
Trojan after Trojan, and shouting to the Greeks
to come to his support.
</p>

<p>
It was a grim and desperate struggle.  There
was no shooting of arrows, no casting of javelins
now, but foot to foot, and hand to hand, they fought,
with axe, and sword, and spear.  At last Hector
forced his way to a beautiful galley, which had
brought Protesilaus[<a id="chap14fn1text"></a><a href="#chap14fn1">1</a>] to Troy, and laying his hand
on the high, fanlike ornament of the stern he
shouted: "Bring a torch, that I may be the first
to kindle the fire which shall burn these accursed
ships, which came here for our destruction, but shall
now serve as a pyre for their crews."
</p>

<h3>
Achilles sends Patroclus to Battle
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Patroclus had been long detained by
Eurypylus, whose wound was severe, and
demanded all his skill.  But when the roar
of battle drew nearer and nearer, and he heard the
voice of Hector calling for a torch, he would delay
no longer, but sprang up and ran in headlong haste
to the quarters of the Myrmidons.  There he
found Achilles still sitting before his tent, and
listening to the mingled cries of triumph and
dismay which came from the distant scene of
conflict.  When Patroclus saw him, he came and
stood by his side, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
</p>

<p>
"Why weepest thou, Patroclus," asked Achilles,
"like a little maid, who runs by her mother's side,
plucking her by the gown, and looking into her
face with tearful eyes, begging to be carried?
What means this melting mood?  Hast thou ill
news of thy father, or of mine, or are these tears
for the Greeks, now perishing by their own transgression?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! son of Peleus," answered Patroclus, with a
pitiful sigh, "take not my words amiss, but I am
sore afflicted for the sake of my countrymen.  Their
best and noblest are grievously wounded, and the
leeches are busy about them; and those that
remain can no longer make head against the foe.
Can nothing move thee?  What avails all thy
splendid manhood, if thou wilt sit idle here, until
thine arm is palsied with age?  Oh! yet at last
relent, if thou art indeed the son of gentle Thetis,
and not some savage changeling, born of the rocks,
and nourished by the sea!  If thou wilt not go to
the field thyself, at least let me put on thine armour,
and lead the Myrmidons to aid our friends in their
dreadful strait."
</p>

<p>
For some time Achilles answered nothing, and
it was evident that a sore struggle was passing in
his breast.  At last he looked up, and said with an
effort: "Thou hast prevailed, son of Men&oelig;tius,
though I vowed that I would never cease from
mine anger until the fire had reached my own ships.
When I think of the foul outrage&mdash;&mdash;  But enough!
Down, down, rebellious pride!"  He paused, frowning,
and grinding his teeth; for the fierce fit had
come on him again.  Then, mastering himself, he
continued: "Thou shalt have my armour, and lead
the Myrmidons to battle.  But take heed to what
I shall say, and let not thine ardour carry thee too
far, but when thou hast driven the enemy out of
the camp lead thy men back, and be not tempted
to fight in the open field, lest thou rob me of mine
honour, and leave naught for me to do.  Remember
this, and have a care for thyself, for they have a
mighty ally on their side, even Apollo."
</p>

<p>
While they were thus conversing, Ajax was still
keeping up an unequal struggle against an
overpowering force.  The Trojans surrounded the ship
on which he was fighting, and plied him with a shower
of missiles, which rattled on his helmet, and
threatened every moment to bring him down.  His left
shoulder ached with holding his shield, which was
thrust back upon him by a dozen spears at once.
Yet still he fought on, with his breath coming in
heavy gasps, and the sweat pouring from every
limb.  Then Hector aimed a blow with his sword,
and cut off the head of the pike which Ajax was
wielding.  Thus left without a weapon, Ajax was
compelled at last to retreat, and the Trojans rushed
forward, and set fire to the ship.
</p>

<p>
Achilles saw the smoke rising, and cried: "Arm
thee, Patroclus.  Make haste!  I will go and call
up the Myrmidons."  Patroclus hurried to the tent,
and put on the armour of Achilles&mdash;the greaves and
starry corslet, the helmet and vast orbed shield&mdash;and
girded on his great comrade's sword.  Only
the spear of Achilles he took not, for no arm in all
the host, save only the arm of Achilles, could wield
that ponderous beam of ash, toughened by many
a storm on the windy slopes of Pelion, where it grew.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Automedon, Achilles' charioteer, was
yoking to the car the two immortal steeds&mdash;Xanthus
and Balius&mdash;offspring of the West Wind, and
nourished on the meadows by the shores of
Oceanus.  And with them went as a trace horse
the mortal courser, Pedasus, which Achilles had
taken among the spoils when he sacked the city
of EÃ«tion.
</p>

<p>
When the Myrmidons heard their leader's voice
calling them to arms, they rushed forth from their
tents, like thirsty wolves which have gorged
themselves with the flesh of a tall stag, and now hasten,
with bloodstained chaps and lolling tongues, to
slake their thirst in a deep mountain pool.  With
like eagerness arose the hardy veterans, whose
warlike spirit had been fed high by their long
repose; and proud was the glance of Achilles, as
he glanced down the armed files, marshalled under
five famous captains, five times five hundred men.
When all were standing silent at their posts he
addressed them briefly, and said: "Now is the
time to make good the threats which ye uttered
against the Trojans, during all the long time of my
wrath.  Remember how ye murmured against me
because I suffered you not to go unto battle.
'Hard-hearted son of Peleus,' ye would say,
'surely thy mother nourished thee with gall, and
therefore art thou so ruthless to thy loving
comrades, keeping them here in inglorious ease.'  See
that your deeds are as valiant as your words, and
let the Trojans feel the weight of your arm this day."
</p>

<p>
Firm and close as blocks of stone, fitted together
by a master-builder to be the wall of some great
house, so stood the warriors in that invincible
column, shield leaning on shield, and man on man;
and in the van were seen the tall figures of Patroclus
and Automedon, two leaders with one heart.  Then
Achilles went to his tent, and brought forth a golden
goblet, a gift from his mother, and sacred to the
service of Zeus.  Having purified it with sulphur,
and washed it with fresh water, he cleansed his
own hands, and filling the bowl with wine returned
to the open space before the tent.  Then lifting up
his eyes to heaven he poured the drink-offering,
and prayed thus to the king and lord of Olympus:
"O thou, whose ancient dwelling is in wintry
Dodona, where thy chosen priests serve thee day
and night with fasting and prayer, as thou hast
lent thine ear to my former petition, and grievously
afflicted the Greeks for my sake, so grant me once
more my heart's desire.  Let thine eyes rest with
favour on my noble comrade, and give him honour
in the battle.  And when he hath driven the
Trojans from the camp bring him back safe, with
his armour, and all this company, to our tents."
</p>

<p>
So prayed he in his ignorance, having yet to
learn that Zeus is a jealous god, dispensing his
gifts with unequal hand, two evil for one good.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Like a swarm of wasps which have their nest
by the roadside, and being ever provoked by
wanton children wreak their vengeance on some
harmless wayfarer; so flew the Myrmidons to join
the fray, and soon the Trojans felt their sting.
"For Achilles and for honour!" shouted Patroclus,
as he hurled his spear, and struck down PyrÃ¦chmes,
the savage leader of a wild mountain tribe from
northern Greece.  The rude clansmen fled when
they saw their leader fall, and soon the panic
spread to the whole Trojan army, and they too
fled, leaving the burning ship, the flames of which
were soon quenched by a score of eager hands.
Like a cloud which lies heavy on a mountain top,
and is then suddenly rent and dispersed, revealing
all the long range of countless hills, peak beyond
peak, far away to the distant sea, with green glades
between, and above the boundless chasm of sky,
up to the dazzling zenith: so was dispersed that
cloud of Trojans which had hung about the ships,
and the Greeks saw the fair face of Hope again.
</p>

<p>
But the end of that long and bloody day was
still far off.  Outside the barriers the Trojans
rallied again, and a fearful slaughter ensued.  There
the sword of Patroclus bit deep, making dire havoc
among the ranks of the Lycians, until Sarpedon,
their leader, incensed by the slaughter of his men,
sprang from his car, and threw himself in the way,
to arrest that destroying hand.
</p>

<p>
Like two vultures, which tear each other with
beak and claw, fighting with loud screams on a lofty
crag, so leapt the two champions, the Lycian and
the Greek, upon each other, uttering loud their
battle-cry.
</p>

<p>
When Zeus saw his son Sarpedon about to
engage in deadly combat with Patroclus he was
filled with pity, for he knew that the Lycian
chieftain was going to his doom.  "How sayest thou,
Hera," he began, "shall I save him, and waft him
away in a cloud to his fair domain in Lycia, or shall
I leave him to his fate?"
</p>

<p>
"That must not be," answered Hera.  "His
thread is spun, and his life is forfeit; shouldst thou
annul that decree it will be an evil example to the
other gods, who will forthwith all seek to avert the
stroke of fate from their sons, of whom many are
fighting in the fields of Troy.  If thou wouldst do
him honour, send Death and gentle Sleep to bear
him softly, after he has fallen, from the battlefield,
and bring him to his kinsfolk in Lycia, that they
may pay him the rites which are due to the mighty
dead."
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast persuaded me," answered Zeus,
bowing his immortal head in sorrow.  And he
caused a rain of blood to fall upon the earth, in sad
tribute to the heroic spirit which was about to pass
away.
</p>

<p>
While this debate was proceeding, the struggle
had already begun.  In the first cast of their spears
both warriors missed their aim.  Patroclus slew
the comrade of Sarpedon, while Sarpedon's lance
struck Pedasus, the mortal steed, in the shoulder,
and he fell dead.  His immortal companions
plunged wildly, striving to break away from the
yoke when they saw their comrade slain.  But
Automedon cut the traces by which the slaughtered
steed was attached to the car; and, being rid of
their sad burden, Xanthus and Balius were once
more obedient to the rein.
</p>

<p>
Again the heroes flung their spears, and the
weapon of Sarpedon flew over his antagonist's left
shoulder.  But the spear of Patroclus sank deep
into Sarpedon's breast, and he fell, writhing in his
death agony, and sending forth loud groans, like a
bull when he feels the lion's claws tearing his flanks.
So raged Sarpedon in the pangs of death, and
rolling his eyes he sought the familiar face of
his beloved Glaucus.  "Friend of my heart!"
he cried, "valiant Glaucus, companion of all my
toils, now must thou prove thy manly worth.  Rally
round thee the stoutest of the Lycians, and let not
thy foot go back, or thy hand cease from slaying,
until thou hast saved my body from the Greeks.
To thee I shall be a reproach, and a hanging of the
head, even unto thy life's end, if thou leave me,
a rifled and dishonoured corpse, in the hands of the foe."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke, death stopped his breath and
darkened his eyes.  And Patroclus set his foot on
the corpse, and drew forth his spear, while the
Myrmidons took possession of the empty car with
its affrighted steeds.
</p>

<p>
Glaucus was in dire distress when he heard his
dying comrade's voice.  But he was disabled by
the wound which he had received in scaling the
wall.  Nursing his injured arm, he prayed aloud
to Apollo: "Hear me, O King, whether thou art
now in Lycia or in Troy; for thine ear is ever open
to the cry of need, however far away.  My hand is
maimed, and my arm is burning with sharp pains,
so that I cannot wield my spear, though Sarpedon
is fallen, and his father hath forsaken him.  So
forsake thou not me, but heal my wound, and give
me back my strength, that I may save his body
from outrage."
</p>

<p>
Apollo heard, and granted his prayer, and
straightway the flow of his blood was stopped,
and he felt in his body that he was healed of his
hurt.  Then Glaucus was glad, and he made all
haste to do his comrade's bidding.  First he
called to the men of Lycia to do battle for their
slaughtered captain, and then he went to rouse
the Trojan leaders to do their duty by their great
ally.  Finding Hector engaged in another part of
the field, he reproached him for his neglect.  "Hast
thou forgotten," he asked indignantly, "what thou
owest to us, who have come on a far journey to
shed our blood for thee and thy country?  Cold
lies Sarpedon, chief pillar of thine allies; come,
friends, and help us to save his corpse, or ye will
be shamed for ever."
</p>

<p>
This was bitter news for the Trojans, who
reverenced Sarpedon as the chief corner-stone of
their defence; and they rushed with one accord to
avenge his death.  Patroclus on his side summoned
the bravest of the Greeks to his aid, and the whole
fury of the struggle was now centred in the place
where the dead Sarpedon lay.
</p>

<p>
The first who fell in this new battle was a friend
of Patroclus, who years ago had found a new home
in the house of Peleus, having been banished from
his own country for the murder of his cousin.  He
was now struck down by a stone from the hand of
Hector; and Patroclus, in his anger at his comrade's
death, made so furious an assault that the Trojans
gave way before him about the length of a spear's
cast.  Then Glaucus advanced again, and slew
Bathycles, a man of high note among the
Myrmidons; and Meriones on the other side killed
Laogonus, the priest of IdÃ¦an Zeus.  Ã†neas, ever
famed for his piety, hurled his spear at Meriones,
hoping to avenge the fall of that sacred head; but
Meriones stooped low, and the spear flew over
his head, and sunk deep in the ground, with
quivering shaft, just behind him.  "The Cretan can
dance, I see!" shouted Ã†neas; "he comes from
a land of dancers."  "Thou shall dance to my
piping, before thou hast done," answered Meriones
derisively.  "Thinkest thou that we owe thee a life
for every cast of thy spear?"  "Peace!" said
Patroclus, rebuking him.  "We must fight with
our swords, not with our tongues, if we would do
aught worthy here."
</p>

<p>
Thick and fast rained the blows, on shield and
helmet and mailed breast, as the two armies closed
again, and the sound was as of an army of
woodmen plying their axes together in a deep mountain
glade.  In the midst lay the lifeless Sarpedon,
covered from head to foot with javelins, and blood,
and dust, so that his dearest friend could not have
recognised his face.  Like flies buzzing round a
milk pail, so thronged the Greeks and Trojans
round the body.
</p>

<p>
Zeus sat watching the battle, pondering in his
heart what measure of glory he should mete out
to Patroclus before he laid him low by the arm
of Hector.  At last, having taken his resolve, he
caused a coward spirit to enter into Hector's heart,
and the Trojan captain wheeled his car, and fled
towards the city.  The panic spread to the other
Trojans, and the Lycians, and they retreated,
leaving the body of Sarpedon in the hands of the
Greeks, who despoiled it of its armour, and were
about to do it further dishonour when a higher
power intervened.  In the very act of violating the
dead, they saw their lifeless victim snatched from
them by an invisible hand; for Apollo had received
the commands of Zeus, and bore away the soiled
and blackened body to the riverside, where he
washed it clean, anointed it with ambrosia, and
gave it, robed in immortal raiment, into the charge
of Sleep and Death, for safe and speedy conveyance
to Lycia.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
High dreams of triumph arose in the heart of
Patroclus when he saw the enemy flying, and,
forgetting the earnest injunction of Achilles, he
bade Automedon lay on the lash, and followed in
hot pursuit.  Even to the very walls he drove; but
then he found awaiting him one mightier than
Hector, even Apollo himself, who shook the Ã¦gis
in his face, and warned him back.  Patroclus
retired a little, and while he hesitated Apollo went
to the gates of the city, where Hector was lingering,
in doubt whether to continue the battle, or to
withdraw behind the walls.
</p>

<p>
"What doest thou here, son of Priam?" said the
god; "come with me, and I will show thee where
the path of glory lies."  When he heard Apollo's
voice, Hector's courage returned, and he
commanded Cebriones, his charioteer, to drive back to
the battlefield.  Avoiding the other Greeks, Hector
made straight for the place where Patroclus had
been left standing by Apollo.  Patroclus came to
meet him, holding his spear in his left hand, while
in his right he grasped a jagged stone.  And as
the car approached, he flung the stone with all his
force, and struck Cebriones on the forehead, shattering
the bones.  The reins dropped from his hands,
and without a single cry he fell from the car,
striking the ground with his head.  "How bravely the
man tumbles!" cried Patroclus.  "He would make
a rare diver, and earn a good wage by bringing up
oysters from the sea.  I perceive that the Trojans
can dance, as well as the Cretans."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon he leapt upon the prostrate charioteer,
and Hector sprang forward to defend his comrade's
body.  So there they met, like two hungry lions
fighting for the carcass of a stag; and the Greeks
and Trojans thronged on either side to their support,
like two winds from opposite quarters, which shatter
the boughs of beech and ash in a mountain forest.
All the ground about the corpse was set thick with
javelins and arrows, and heaped with the stones
which crashed upon corslet and shield.  And there
lay the giant Trojan, while the battle raged above
him, mighty and mightily fallen, and all his
horsemanship forgot.
</p>

<p>
Never had the arm of Patroclus dealt such havoc
among the foemen's ranks as then; for his doom
was near, and Zeus gave him honour in this, his
latest hour.  Thrice he made an onset, fierce as the
god of war himself, and thrice he slew nine men.
But when for the fourth time he sprang to the
encounter, Ph&oelig;bus made after him, and smote him
on the back with his open hand.  Patroclus reeled
and grew dizzy, like one who has received a
sunstroke.  Then Apollo struck the helmet from his
head, and it rolled clattering among the horses'
feet, that mighty brazen helm, whose plumes, now
soiled with dust and gore, had once waved above
the princely brow of Achilles.  The spear was
shivered to pieces in his hand, and his shield slipped
from his shoulder to the ground.  And as he stood
thus, defenceless and amazed, a Trojan, whose
name was Euphorbus, wounded him between the
shoulders with his spear.  The blow was not
mortal, and Patroclus drew back, to mingle with
the press; but Hector followed after him, and
drove his spear deep into his side.  And as a lion
overpowers a wild boar, fighting with him in the
lone mountains for the possession of a little spring,
and slays him by his might, so slew Hector the
valiant son of Men&oelig;tius, and stayed the ravage of
the Trojan ranks.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Patroclus," said he, gazing in triumph on
the dying hero, "thou thoughtest this day to have
taken our city by storm, and led captive the women
of Troy.  But they have in me a defender who is
too strong for thee.  Vain man!  Achilles, I doubt
not, bade thee bring back to him the bloody spoils
of Hector, and now thou liest slain by Hector's
hand."
</p>

<p>
"Boast not," answered Patroclus faintly.  "It is
small glory for thee to have slain the slain.  I
received my death blow from Apollo and Euphorbus,
not from thee.  And thine own fate shall overtake
thee soon, when thou shalt die by the hands of
Ã†acides."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spake the shadow of death fell upon
him, and his soul took wing for the realm of Hades,
bewailing her lot, leaving all that beauty and manly
bloom.
</p>

<h3>
The Fight for the Body of Patroclus
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Menelaus was the first to mark the fall of
Patroclus, and he came with a rush and
stood over his body to defend it, like a
young mother of the herd when she stands lowing
plaintively over her calf, the first that she has borne.
Shield on shoulder and spear in hand he stood, glaring
defiance at the foe; and Euphorbus, the Trojan who
had dealt the first blow at Patroclus, took up the
challenge, addressing Menelaus with these haughty
words: "Make way, son of Atreus, and leave me
to take my lawful spoil.  'Twas I that wounded
Patroclus first, and his armour belongs by right to
me.  Back, or thou shalt die the death."
</p>

<p>
"If big words could kill," answered Menelaus,
with scorn, "then wert thou and thy brethren the
most dreaded warriors of all thy nation; for there
are no such windy braggarts in Priam's army.
Away with thee, if thou wouldst have breath left in
thee to boast again."
</p>

<p>
But Euphorbus, though a boaster, and a mere
novice in war, was no coward.  He thrust manfully
at Menelaus, who parried the blow with his shield,
and then, striking in his turn, and throwing all his
weight into the stroke, drove his spear into
Euphorbus' throat, so that the point came out at the back
of his neck.  Down he went, and his armour
clattered upon him, and his love locks, curiously
adorned with gold and silver, were dabbled with
blood.  As when a man tends carefully a green
olive-shoot, in some sheltered spot, near a gushing
fountain-head; and now it is a comely tree, just
bursting into blossom, and lightly rocked by all the
airs of heaven: then comes a sudden tempest, and
uproots it from the soil, and all its promise is
marred: so stricken and cut off in the dawn of his
manhood lay that gallant lad.  And as a lion comes
down from the mountains, trusting in his might, and
strikes down a young heifer feeding in a meadow,
the fairest of the herd, breaking her neck with his
mighty teeth, and then glutting himself with her
blood and her flesh; and the herdsmen with their
hounds stand apart, making great uproar, but not
one dares to interrupt him in his meal: so dared
not one of the Trojans to stand against Menelaus
face to face.
</p>

<p>
Hector, who after slaying Patroclus had gone off
in pursuit of the car of Achilles, was recalled from
that fruitless chase by the tidings of Euphorbus'
death.  With a loud cry of rage he turned back,
and hastened to the place where the young Trojan
lay, side by side with Patroclus.  Menelaus stayed
not to abide his coming, but fell back upon the
ranks of his comrades, and there halted, and scanned
the fighting line, looking for the great Telamonian
Ajax.  Observing him at last on the extreme left
of the battle, he ran up to him, crying eagerly:
"Make haste, Ajax, and aid me to recover the
body of Patroclus, that we may carry it back, naked
as it is, to Achilles; for the armour Hector has
taken already."
</p>

<p>
So together they went, and stood side by side
over the body of Patroclus; and Hector in his
turn shrank back, when he was confronted by
the towering form of Ajax, with his massive,
sevenfold shield.  But he took with him the
armour, and gave it to two of his men to carry to
the city.
</p>

<p>
Glaucus was full of anger when he saw Hector
quail before Ajax, and he reproached him bitterly,
calling him faint-hearted, and false to his great
office.  "It is a thankless task," he said, "to fight
under such a leader.  Henceforth let the Trojans
make shift to defend their city without our aid, for
we of Lycia at least will fight their battles no more.
Basely hast thou dealt with us, after all our good
service, leaving our great captain Sarpedon in the
hands of the Greeks.  If ye of Troy had the spirit
of men, ye would aid us to capture the body of
Patroclus, that we might keep it to exchange for
Sarpedon's corpse.  But thou art a prudent warrior,
and fearest the face of Ajax, knowing him to be a
far better man than thou art."
</p>

<p>
"O folly of the wise!" answered Hector scornfully.
"'Tis Glaucus can talk thus, who hath the rarest
wit, as we are told, among all the men of Lycia.
Come and stand by me, and thou shall see if I fear
the face of Ajax, or any other Greek.  But first I
will put on the armour of Achilles, which was given,
men say, by the gods, as a wedding gift to his father
Peleus."  And with that he ran and overtook the
men who were carrying the spoils of Patroclus
towards the city, and taking off his own armour began
to put on that of Achilles.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<br />
Homer hymning the Fall of Troy. (Baron H. de Triqueti)
</p>

<p>
When Zeus beheld him thus gaily equipping himself
in the spoils of the mighty, he shook his head,
and spake thus to his own heart: "Ah! wretch, thy
triumph will be short lived, and the hand of doom
is stretched out already to take thee.  But thou
shall have thine hour, and Andromache shall hear
of thy deeds, though never more shall she welcome
thee returning from battle."
</p>

<p>
He said it, and confirmed it with a nod, and
forthwith the very demon of war entered into the
heart of Hector, and with a fierce cry he ran back
to the field, glittering in the armour of Pelides, which
seemed to have been wrought for himself, so well it
fitted his limbs.
</p>

<p>
Even the great Ajax felt a cold touch of fear as
Hector bore down upon him, with the most famous
warriors of Troy and Lycia at his back.  "We are
lost," he said to Menelaus, "unless we can get some
other succour to beat back this tempest of
war."  Then, raising his voice, he shouted: "To the
rescue, ye captains and princes of the Greeks!  Let
not Patroclus become a prey to dogs in the streets
of Troy."  His cry was heard, and soon he was
joined by Idomeneus, and Meriones, and the lesser
Ajax.
</p>

<p>
Like the roar of the advancing tide, when it meets
the torrent waters at the mouth of the mighty river,
such was the shout of the Trojans as they rushed to
the onset.  And the Greeks stood firm to meet them,
making a fence with their shields over the body of
Patroclus.  At the first shock of that tremendous
charge they were forced to give ground a little, and
one of the Trojans fastened a thong to the ankle of
the corpse, and began to drag it away.  But he had
not gone far when Ajax sprang upon him, and with
one blow of his sword shivered his helmet, and clave
him to the chin.  This gave time for the Greeks to
rally, and the battle was renewed in that narrow
space round the body of Patroclus, where many a
valiant deed was wrought, and many a hero bit the
dust, fighting for the possession of a helpless corpse.
Over this struggling mass of warriors in the centre
of the field was spread a thick curtain of darkness,
for Zeus had ordered it so, while the rest of the
Greeks and Trojans were fighting in the broad
sunlight.  Far away on the border of the fight were
Antilochus, the son of Nestor, and his brother, who
had not yet heard that Patroclus had been slain.
</p>

<p>
But in that dark kernel of the battle the ruthless
tug of war went on.  There was no stay, no pause,
while they hewed, and thrust, and strove, till
the blinding sweat poured down into their eyes,
and their knees shook with weariness.  As when
a master currier gives to his journeymen a great
bull's hide, well drenched with fat, to be stretched,
and they stand in a circle, and tug with all their
might, straining it equally on all sides, until all
moisture departs from it, and the fat penetrates to
every pore; so they tugged the body between
them, this way and that, the Trojans haling it
towards the city, and the Greeks towards their
camp.  "Die, ye Greeks!" cried Ajax, who was
fighting like twenty men; "die, rather than give
up the body to the Trojans."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
After the fall of Patroclus, Automedon had
driven his car out of the press of battle, flying
from the fury of Hector.  When Hector was
recalled from the pursuit, Automedon strove in
vain to stir his horses from the spot where he had
halted.  In vain he plied the lash, in vain he coaxed
and threatened; still as a monumental pillar on a
tomb they stood, with their heads drooping to the
earth, and their glossy manes streaming over their
eyes, while the hot tears dropped fast in the dust,
as they wept for the gentle prince, whom they had
borne so often to battle.
</p>

<p>
Zeus pitied them in their sorrow, and spake thus
within himself: "Ah! hapless pair, why did we
give you to a mortal master, while ye know neither
age nor death?  What part or lot have ye with
human misery, or with man, the most wretched
thing that breathes and moves on earth?  But
Hector shall never mount the car behind you, or
put the bit in your mouths&mdash;I will not suffer that.
Be strong, and bear your driver safe, until the
battle be done."
</p>

<p>
Therewith, he breathed new vigour into the
steeds, and they shook the dust from their manes,
and galloped lightly with the car back to the
fighting lines.  Singlehanded, Automedon could
take no part in the hand-to-hand battle with the
Trojans, and for some time he contented himself
with making rapid charges with his chariot, swooping
down here and there, like an eagle pouncing on
a flock of geese, and easily avoiding every attack.
At last he found a helper in a comrade named
Alcimedon, and handing the reins to him he
dismounted himself to fight on foot.
</p>

<p>
When Hector saw the car of Achilles in charge
of a strange driver he called to Ã†neas, and said:
"See, there are the steeds of Ã†acides, ill-guided,
and ill-defended; let us not miss the occasion to
win so glorious a prize."  So together they went,
Ã†neas and Hector, and two other Trojans, in high
hope to slay Automedon, and take the car.  But
Automedon, uttering a prayer to Zeus, flung his
spear, and slew Aretus, one of his assailants; and
before Hector, who missed his cast at Automedon,
could come to close quarters with his sword, Ajax
interposed, and drove him back.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of Automedon had interrupted the
struggle for the possession of the body of Patroclus;
but it was resumed with new fury on both sides,
and the Greeks now received a new ally in the
person of Athene, who obtained permission from
Zeus to bring aid to her old allies.  Disguised in
the form of the aged Ph&oelig;nix, she went and stood
by the side of Menelaus, and said to him:
"Courage, son of Atreus!  We shall win the battle
yet, and save the noble comrade of Achilles from
the foeman's hands."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Ph&oelig;nix," answered Menelaus, "I would
that Athene would put strength into my arm; then
might I, as far as it is now possible, retrieve the
bitter loss which we have suffered this day."
</p>

<p>
Athene was glad that he had named her before
any other god, and she filled him with an indomitable
spirit, and gave him the stubborn courage of
a fly, which returns again and again to the attack,
in its fierce desire for blood.  And, seeing a good
mark for his spear in the back of a flying Trojan,
Menelaus flung, and pierced him in the waist.  The
man whom he slew was Podes, a son of EÃ«tion, and
a friend and boon companion of Hector.  Provoked
beyond measure by the death of his comrade,
Hector led such a determined charge against the
Greek centre that even the bravest began to flinch;
and to affright them the more there came a
deafening peal of thunder from the heights of Ida,
now wrapped in a pitchy cloud.
</p>

<p>
The first to fly was Peneleos, the bravest of the
B&oelig;otians, whose shoulder had been cut to the
bone by the spear of Polydamas.  Then Idomeneus,
coming to succour a wounded Greek, broke his
spear on Hector's breastplate, and it would have
gone hard with him had not C&oelig;ranus, a Cretan,
driven up to the rescue in the car of Meriones; for
Idomeneus had come to the field on foot, leaving
his own car in the camp.  The brave C&oelig;ranus
paid for this good service with his life, sustaining
a fearful thrust from Hector's spear, which struck
him just at the angle of the jaw, and severed his
tongue at the root.  He fell from the car, and
dropped the reins on the ground; but Meriones
picked them up, and gave them to Idomeneus, who
drove off at full speed towards the ships.
</p>

<p>
Thus deprived of his bravest supporters, Ajax
cast a glance of dismay at Menelaus, who was
still fighting at his side, and said: "Alas! even
a blind man might see that Zeus himself is aiding
the Trojans.  Every weapon of theirs finds its
mark, let it be hurled by ever so weak a hand;
but our spears fall idle to the ground, one and all.
Yet, abandoned though we are, let us take thought
how we may save the body of Patroclus, and
ourselves return alive to gladden the eyes of our
faithful comrades, who methinks are in sore
distress, thinking that the might and the murderous
hands of Hector shall no more be stayed until they
have hurled destruction on our fleet.  Also I would
fain despatch a messenger to bear the bitter tidings
to Pelides, who dreams not that his beloved
Patroclus has perished.  But I cannot see anyone
to whom I might deliver this charge, for men and
steeds alike are covered by thick darkness.  Dread
sire of heaven, at least from darkness deliver the
sons of Greece!  Bring back the day, and give us
the sight of our eyes.  Slay us, if die we must&mdash;but
slay us in the light!"
</p>

<p>
Zeus had compassion on that brave man in his
agony, and forthwith the thick cloud of darkness
was removed, and the sun shone out, and all the
field of battle was disclosed to view.  "Now haste,
Menelaus," said Ajax.  "Go thou, and find
Antilochus, who is very dear to Achilles, and bid
him carry this message, which none other may dare
to bring."
</p>

<p>
Menelaus was very reluctant to leave his place
among the defenders of Patroclus.  Slowly, and
with many a backward glance, he turned to go,
like a lion who is driven off at dawn by a shower
of javelins and burning brands, after he has prowled
all night round the stalls where fat oxen are housed.
"Ah! remember," he said earnestly, pausing once
more, "remember how dear, how gentle he was
to us all, this poor Patroclus, who now lies cold in
death.  Forsake him not, but stand by him till I
come back."
</p>

<p>
After this fervent appeal he made all haste, and
ran along the fighting line, looking about him with
a piercing glance, like an eagle soaring high in the
heaven, who spies out a hare as she crouches in the
shadow of a thicket.  So did the keen eye of
Menelaus soon discern where Antilochus was fighting,
on the extreme left of the field.  "Dire is the
news I bring," said Menelaus, halting by his side:
"Patroclus is slain, Hector has his armour, and
thou art chosen to tell Achilles of his loss, that
if it be possible he may yet save the body."
</p>

<p>
With parted lips, and eyes staring with horror,
Antilochus stood gazing at the bringer of the
message of woe.  Then dashing the tears from his eyes,
and drawing a deep sobbing breath, he flung down
his shield and sped away on his mournful errand.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent him," said Menelaus, when he had
returned with all speed to the defenders of the
fallen Patroclus.  "I know not what Achilles will
do&mdash;he cannot fight without armour.  But to our
task."  "The Trojans have drawn off a little,"
answered Ajax.  "Now is the time: do thou and
Meriones take the corpse on your shoulders, while
I and my brother-in-arms hold the foe in play."
</p>

<p>
Without a moment's delay Menelaus and Meriones
hoisted the body on their shoulders and began to
carry it towards the camp: which when the Trojans
saw, they raised a great shout, and rushed after,
like hounds attacking a wounded wild boar; but
as the hounds are scattered when the great brute
wheels to the charge, so fled the Trojans before the
determined stand of Ajax and his comrade.
</p>

<p>
But only for a moment: on they came again, fierce
as a mighty conflagration, which sweeps through
the streets of a town, driven before the gale, while
the houses melt away like wax in the flames: with
like furious uproar came horse and foot hard at their
heels, as they bore the body from the field.  But
stoutly and stubbornly they plodded on with their
burden, panting and sweating like a pair of mules
which drag a heavy beam down a rugged mountain
path: and behind them those two doughty champions
opposed an impassable barrier to the Trojans, like
a long wooded mountain spur, which hurls back the
fierce assault of a swollen stream, and cannot be
broken.
</p>

<p>
Yet even now the issue seemed doubtful; for just
as the bearers reached the barriers of the camp
Hector and Ã†neas led a vigorous charge, scattering
the Greeks as a hawk scatters a noisy mob of
starlings or daws.
</p>

<h3>
The News is brought to Achilles
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
"Why tarries Patroclus so long?" asked
Achilles of himself, as he sat waiting by
his tent.  "Alas!  I fear that he hath
disobeyed me, and lost his life by his rashness.  Did
not my mother tell me that the noblest of the Greeks
should fall in battle with the Trojans while I
lived?"  His alarm increased when he saw straggling parties
of the Greeks entering the camp, with every sign of
panic and defeat.  Presently the roar of the struggle
drew nearer and nearer, and he had just determined
to rush to the ramparts, and learn the worst, when
Antilochus came running up, and in broken accents
panted out his dreadful message.
</p>

<p>
As when a thunderbolt descends, laying low some
giant of the forest, so fell the mighty Pelides, laid
prostrate beneath that stunning blow.  Then that
proud head, which had never bowed to mortal man,
was defiled with dust, and those heroic limbs, the
very mould of manly strength and beauty, grovelled
and writhed on the ground.  He tore his hair, cast
ashes on his head, and moaned like a wounded beast
in his agony.  And all the handmaids whom he had
taken in war gathered round him, wailing and beating
their breasts; for sorrow was their portion, and
their tears were ever ready to flow.  By his side
knelt Antilochus, holding his hands, in fear lest he
should do violence to his life.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles shook off the grasp of Antilochus,
and started to his feet with a fearful cry, glaring
wildly, like one about to do some desperate act.
But just at this moment a sound of female voices
came floating over the placid sea, and Thetis glided
into his presence, with all her band of Ocean nymphs
attending.  Achilles flung himself down again when
he saw her, with a fresh burst of grief; and
kneeling by him she embraced him tenderly, and weeping
cried: "O child of my sorrow, what new cause of
mourning hath reached thee now?  Hath not Zeus
fulfilled his promise, and avenged thine honour?"
</p>

<p>
"What avails his promise, or the fulfilment
thereof?" answered Achilles, groaning bitterly.
"What care I for honour, if I must pay for it with
the life of my best beloved?  He lies in his blood,
and Hector, his slayer, has taken the glorious armour
which the gods gave to Peleus when they made thee
his unwilling bride.  'Twas a woeful match, for thee
and for me, and soon thou shall reap the bitter fruit,
for Hector must die by my hand, to appease the
ghost of Patroclus, and thou hast told me that, when
Hector falls, my own end is not far off."  A mournful
silence followed, broken only by the sobs of Thetis,
who knew her son had pronounced his own doom.
Then Achilles burst out again, in louder and
angrier tones: "But let me die, when that task is
done!  What has life been to me?&mdash;a burden to
myself, and a curse to others!  Here have I lain, like
a useless trunk, encumbering the sod, and left my
comrades to perish, and given him, the very light of
mine eyes, to be a prey to the spoiler.  Accursed,
and thrice accursed, be the spirit of strife, which
trickles, sweeter than honey, into the hearts of men,
and rises up again, in words more bitter than
gall!&mdash;even as Agamemnon provoked me to fierce anger,
which now comes back upon me, with thrice
envenomed sting.  But past is past&mdash;we will speak no
more of that.  My fate calls me to vengeance&mdash;and
after that the grave.  Then away, soft visitings
of love and gentle sorrow!  And thou, fond heart,
become a stone!  I will strew with havoc the path
which leads me to mine enemy, and the streets of
Troy shall be filled with lamentation, and women
wailing for their dead."
</p>

<p>
"I know that I cannot shake thy purpose,"
answered Thetis sadly, "and it shall be as thou
hast said.  But unarmed thou canst not go into
battle.  Remain here therefore until my return, and
by to-morrow's dawn I will bring thee such armour
as never mortal wore."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
While these events were passing, the struggle
over the slain Patroclus raged fiercer than ever.
Slowly the Greeks were driven back to the very
gates of their camp, and at the eleventh hour that
pitiful prize which had cost so much blood would
have fallen into the hands of the Trojans, had not
Hera intervened and sent Iris to summon Achilles
to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
"Rouse thee, son of Peleus!" said Iris, appearing
at his side.  "Hector hath sworn to set the head
of Patroclus on the battlements of Troy, and he will
accomplish his threat if thou sittest idle here."
</p>

<p>
"How can I go unarmed to the field?" answered
Achilles.  "I know of none whose armour I might
wear, save only Ajax, and he is fighting at the
front."
</p>

<p>
"No more words," replied Iris.  "Do as thou
art bidden, and heaven will find a way."  Then
Achilles arose, and went to the ramparts; and
Athene drew near him, and threw her tasselled
Ã¦gis over his shoulders, and on his head she caused
a golden cloud to descend, which shot forth rays
of angry light.  As in a beleaguered city, where a
thousand watch-fires are lighted, and all day long the
pillars of smoke ascend, but in the darkness the red
blaze is seen afar, a signal of distress to distant
allies&mdash;so shone that unearthly fire on the head of
Achilles, as he stood on the brink of the moat.
Then he lifted up his voice, and shouted; and the
sound was as the sound of a trumpet summoning
to arms.
</p>

<p>
When they saw the dreadful light, and heard the
brazen voice of Pelides, the Trojans were astonished,
and halted in the midst of their wild assault; and
while they wavered the Greeks fell upon them, and
drove them back in disorder.  The tide had turned
at last, and the long day of battle, so full of strange
revolutions of fortune, came to an end.
</p>

<p>
Slowly and reverently the body of Patroclus was
laid upon a bier, and carried to the tent of Achilles.
But a few short hours before he had gone forth,
with horses and with chariots, to battle, in the pride of
youth and strength; and now he lay cold in death,
gored with hideous wounds by Trojan spears.
And all night long Achilles and his comrades mourned
for their slaughtered hero, the gentlest and the best
of all their band.  Like a lion who leaves his whelps
in their dark forest lair, and returns to find his bed
empty, and his young ones gone; roaring with rage
and grief he tracks the footsteps of the robber along
many a mountain path, and all the forest is filled
with the sound of his wrath: such was Pelides in his
sorrow, and such the voice of his mourning.  "Vain,
alas! was the promise which I made to thy father
Men&oelig;tius, that I would bring thee back safe to thy
home in Locris, loaded with the spoils of Troy.
Thy blood is red on the Trojan sod, where mine too
shall flow before many days are passed.  Now hear
my vow, Patroclus, and take comfort, even in death
I will not pay the last rites to thy corpse until I have
brought Hector's body hither, with the armour
which he has taken, and slain twelve Trojan captives
as a sacrifice to thy shade.  Till then thou shalt lie
as thou art, and the women of Troy, whom we won
with the might of our hands, shall mourn thee night
and day."
</p>

<p>
Then they washed the body, and anointed it with
fragrant oil, and laid it, wrapped in fine linen, on a
bed to wait for burial.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The Trojans still kept the field, though with far
other feelings than when they lit their camp-fires,
only the night before.  Before ever they thought
of supper the chiefs met in council, and stood about
in anxious groups, waiting until some recognised
leader should advise them in their present strait.
Then Polydamas, who was esteemed the wisest
head among them, came forward and commanded
silence; and all listened attentive to hear what he
should say.  "Friends," he began, "ye had best
take heed what ye do; as for me, I have but one
thing to advise&mdash;back to the city, and let not
to-morrow's dawn find us here!  We have all had our
hopes, and I among the rest; but all those hopes
are fled now that Achilles has arisen again; and if
we abide his coming we shall learn too late what it
means to face him in the open field.  Here, where
we stand, dogs and vultures will hold their foul revel,
and batten on our flesh, at the going-down of the
sun.  Therefore, I say again, back to the city, and
put a stout bulwark of stone and oak between
yourselves and this terrible man.  To-morrow we will
man the walls, and laugh at his fury if he seeks to
assail us there.  Yea, his steeds shall weary with
drawing his car, and he himself shall sicken of the
vain attempt, for he knows well that Troy is not
destined to fall by his hands."
</p>

<p>
So ran the counsels of prudence; but another
spirit was there also&mdash;the spirit of rash confidence
and unauthorised ambition&mdash;and it found passionate
utterance in the voice of Hector, who was the next
to speak.  "I like not thy words, Polydamas," said
he, with an angry look; "I like not the cowardly
counsel which bids us skulk behind our walls.  Who
is not sick of our long confinement in that pinfold
there?  We have drained our treasury, and scattered
abroad the wealth for which Troy was once famed
throughout the world, wherever human speech is
heard.  But now that we have been vouchsafed the
glorious promise of carrying the war into the enemy's
camp, and driving these hounds of war out of our
land&mdash;now, I say, unlock no more the thoughts of
thy base soul, to damp our courage, and quench the
bright flame of hope which has been kindled in our
breasts.  Now hear what I advise: to-night we
will hold our camp here, and keep watch in turn;
and to-morrow at first peep of day we will put on our
armour and march against the Grecian stronghold.
Achilles is arisen, sayest thou?  The worse for him:
I will not fly before him, but will meet him face to
face, and slay him, or be slain."
</p>

<p>
The fiery eloquence of Hector carried his hearers
with him, and they resolved with one accord to remain
where they were, and abide the issue.
</p>

<h3>
The Shield of Achilles
</h3>

<p>
Mindful of her promise, Thetis, when she
left Achilles, went straightway to Olympus
and entered the dwelling of HephÃ¦stus.
It was a wondrous structure, all of brass, which
the lame god had planned and fashioned by his own
skill and labour.  She found him in his forge,
blowing up the fire with his bellows; for he was hard
at work, setting the finish to twenty brazen vessels,
for use in his house.  Each vessel ran on golden
wheels, and moved to and fro of its own accord,
coming and going at the master's bidding.  With
him sat Charis, his wife, watching her husband at
his toil; and when she saw Thetis enter she came
forward to greet her, and placed a chair, inlaid with
silver, for her to sit on.  Then she called to
HephÃ¦stus, who was stooping over his forge, and said:
"Leave thy work, and come and welcome this
honoured guest."
</p>

<p>
"Welcome indeed she is, and honoured too,"
said the hospitable god, limping across the stithy
with outstretched hands.  "Did she not save me
from my shrewish mother, who was ashamed of her
crippled son, and sought to put me out of the way,
when I was but a child?  Then it would have gone
hard with me if Thetis had not received me into her
home, the deep cavern, round which Oceanus wraps
his watery coils, foaming and thundering
everlastingly.  There I dwelt in peace for nine long years,
and many a pretty jewel I wrought for my
preservers&mdash;brooches, and bracelets and necklaces.
And none of the gods knew where I was, save only
kind Thetis and Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus.
Therefore thrice welcome, sweet lady of the sea!
I owe thee my life, and shall be rejoiced if I can
pay part of the debt.  Take her, dear Charis, to
the guest-chamber, while I put away the implements
of my trade."
</p>

<p>
Thetis left the forge with her hostess, and when
they were gone HephÃ¦stus gathered up his tools,
and turned the bellows away from the fire.  The
tools he placed in a vast silver chest, and then
taking a sponge he cleansed his face and hands, his
brawny neck, and hairy chest.  Then he put on a
clean tunic, and went to join Charis and her guest.
His huge heavy frame was ill supported on a pair
of thin, crooked legs; but his own inventive genius
had enabled him to supply this defect, for on either
side of him walked a wonderful creature, wrought
by himself in gold, with the form and face of a
maiden, a human voice, and human wit.  Leaning
on these strange supporters, he entered the
guest-chamber, and sat down by the side of Thetis.
"What need," he asked, "has brought thee to my
poor house&mdash;an angel's visit, indeed, to me, both
rare and dear?"
</p>

<p>
Encouraged by the cordial tone of the good-natured
god, Thetis poured out afresh all the tale
of her woes, beginning from the time when, sorely
against her will, she became the bride of Peleus.  He
was now an old man, broken and infirm, and she
a goddess, radiant in her immortal bloom, was still
chained to the human wreck, and Achilles, her son,
still in the prime of his splendid manhood, was a
perpetual source of trouble and grief.  "Few
indeed," she went on, "and evil, are the days of his
life.  First foully insulted by his sovereign, and
now broken-hearted at the loss of his dearest friend!
Help me to do what I can to comfort him in this
bitter hour; lend me thy skill, and make him a suit of
armour such as never mortal man hath worn before."
</p>

<p>
"If that be all," answered HephÃ¦stus cheerfully,
"thy prayer is granted as soon as uttered.  Arms
he shall have, which shall make him the wonder of
the world when he goes forth to battle."
</p>

<p>
Then leaving Thetis in charge of his wife he
went back to his forge, and having stripped to the
waist addressed himself to his work.  Round the
furnace in the centre of the stithy were twenty pairs
of bellows, each serving a separate smelting oven.
These he now turned to the fire, and commanded
them to blow, for they were endowed with a
consciousness of their own, and obeyed the master's
will, now sending forth a tremendous blast, which
made the fire roar with fury, and the flames leap
upward to the roof, now breathing low, like some
huge monster in his softer mood.  Into the smelting
ovens he cast bronze and tin, silver and gold;
and when his metal was ready he placed a ponderous
anvil on the anvil block, and took in one hand
a mighty hammer, while in the other he grasped
the tongs.
</p>

<p>
And first a shield he fashioned, vast and strong,[<a id="chap18fn1text"></a><a href="#chap18fn1">1</a>]
with threefold rim, and baldric of silver.  The
shield was of five folds; and on it he wrought many
a pictured scene with wondrous skill.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap18fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap18fn1text">1</a>] This line is from Cowper's version.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There were imaged earth and sea, the unwearied
sun, and the moon in her waxing and her waning,
and the heavens with all their starry crown&mdash;Pleiades,
and Hyades, and Orion's might, and the Bear, whom
men likewise call the Wain, who turns on the same
spot, and watches Orion, and alone has no share in
the baths of Ocean.
</p>

<p>
And there was fashioned many a scene from
human life, peace and war, pastime and industry.
The first was a city, and along the streets a bridal
procession was passing, with blazing torches, and
the loud hymeneal song, and the whirl of dancers,
and the music of flute and harp; and the women
stood at their thresholds, admiring that gay
company.  But in the market-place was heard the voice
of loud dispute; for the elders were met in their
session, to decide a quarrel concerning the
blood-price of a murdered man.  The slayer brought
witnesses to prove that he had paid the whole
amount; but the plaintiff denied that he had
received a doit.  Outside the circle stood the clamorous
mob, eager partisans of either side, and held in
check by the heralds with their rods of office, and
in the midst sat the elders in solemn conclave on
their seats of polished stone, rising up in turn to
give sentence.  And he whose judgment was held
wisest was to receive a reward of two talents of gold.
</p>

<p>
A second city there was, hard beset by stress of
war.  For about it lay two armies encamped, whose
counsels were divided: in one the leaders were for
taking the city by storm, while in the other they
would have made a treaty, by which the citizens
were to buy off the attack with half their goods.
But while the besiegers were disputing, the citizens
left their walls to be defended by the old men and
the weaker sort, and sallied out in full force to lay
an ambush for a convoy which was on its way to
the enemy's camp.  So forth they marched, with
Ares and Athene at their head, distinguished by
their towering stature and golden armour.  And
when they came to the chosen place of ambush, by
the riverside, where was a watering-place for flocks
and herds, they crouched down among the bushes,
leaving two scouts to warn them of the convoy's
approach.  Soon they heard the lowing of cattle,
and the bleating of sheep, and the sound of the
herdsmen's pipes, as they came on, dreaming of no
harm; then forth rushed the armed troop, and cut
down the herdsmen, and began to drive off the beasts.
</p>

<p>
The cries of the herdsmen, and the bellowing of
the affrighted beasts, reached the ears of the
besiegers, as they sat in council, and seizing their
arms they mounted their horses, and hurried to the
rescue.  Then began a furious struggle, in which
all the demons of war&mdash;Strife, and Confusion, and
deadly Fate&mdash;held high carnival, and drank deep of
human blood.[<a id="chap18fn2text"></a><a href="#chap18fn2">2</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap18fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap18fn2text">2</a>] It should be observed that the poet
gives the whole succession of
incidents which are merely hinted at by the artist,
who is confined
to one moment in the story.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then followed diverse scenes of happy toil.  The
first was a fair fallow land of rich tilth, where
ploughmen were driving their teams to and fro, drawing
long furrows, straight and deep, and pausing now
and then to refresh themselves with a cup of wine,
which was handed to them by a man who stood
ready at the end of the field.  Dark rose the
curling furrow, as the ploughshare passed, and the sods
seemed of rich black soil, though wrought in gold;
for therein was displayed the artist's skill.
</p>

<p>
The next was a harvest of yellow corn, and a
row of busy reapers with sharp sickles in their
hands.  Others stood ready to bind the sheaves,
and these again were supplied by a willing troop
of boys, who gathered up the swathe as fast as
it fell, and handed the ripe bundles to the binders.
Near at hand stood the master, rejoicing in his
wealth; and under a tree at the border of the field
the henchmen were slaughtering an ox, to make
savoury meat for him and his guests, while women
were preparing a mess of pottage for the reapers.
</p>

<p>
Likewise he fashioned a vineyard, heavy with
great clusters of grapes, and along the rows moved
a merry troop of boys and girls, with baskets in
their hands, gathering the luscious fruit; and when
their baskets were full they brought their burdens
home with dancing steps, led by a boy who played
the harp and sang the sweet dirge of summer in
his shrill, childish voice.
</p>

<p>
Then came a herd of oxen going to pasture, and
lowing as they went along the waving rushes,
along the murmuring stream.  Four herdsmen
followed, and with them were nine dogs.  But lo! a
noble bull, the leader of the herd, falls suddenly
in his tracks, struck down by the claws of two
ravening lions.  They begin to drag him off, and
the herdsmen follow at a distance, cheering on their
dogs, which leap and bay wildly, but will not close
with those terrible robbers.
</p>

<p>
The last scene of all was a dance of youths and
maidens, the youths clad in close-fitting doublets,
and wearing hangers at their sides, and the maidens
wearing light garments of linen, and circlets of gold
on their heads.  Holding one another by the wrist,
they first moved in a giddy circle, swift and true
as the wheel flies in the potter's hands, and then
they parted in two rows, and met again, weaving
and unweaving all the mazy figures of a Cretan
dance, while two tumblers whirled among them,
and a singer gave the time with his voice.
</p>

<p>
Framing this rich succession of pictures ran the
broad stream of Oceanus, rolling his waters round
the outer rim of the shield.
</p>

<p>
Corslet, and greaves, and helmet with crest of
gold, were fashioned next, and when the great
work was done, HephÃ¦stus brought it and laid it
at the feet of Thetis.  After due thanks, she took
leave of her generous friends, and then sped on
her way to the Grecian camp, bearing the costly
gift of HephÃ¦stus to her son.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
The Reconciliation
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Dawn was beginning to redden the waters
of the Hellespont when Thetis reached the
tent of Achilles.  She found him sitting, lost
in a gloomy reverie, by the side of the bed on which
the body of Patroclus lay.  "Come," said Thetis,
touching him lightly on the shoulder, "let the
dead bury their dead, and behold the glorious
armour which HephÃ¦stus has wrought for thee."
</p>

<p>
With that she set down the dazzling panoply,
fresh from the forge of the god; the ethereal metal
rang with a dreadful sound, and from the burnished
surface darted angry beams of light, blinding the
eyes of the Myrmidons who had drawn near to
gaze, so that they fled in terror from the sight.
But the eyes of Achilles flashed with an answering
fire, and his heart burned with fierce joy, as he
handled the work of the immortal armourer.
"Mother," he said, when he had scrutinised every
piece, "the work is worthy of the artist&mdash;I can say
no more.  And now to battle!  Yet one thing
I fear&mdash;lest the body of my friend be marred by
decay before my vow is accomplished and I am
free to bury him."
</p>

<p>
"Let not that care disquiet thee," answered
Thetis, "I will find a means to keep off the destroying
hordes of the air, that breathe corruption in the
limbs of fallen warriors.  Though he lie unburied
for the space of a whole year, his flesh shall remain
pure and clean, as the flesh of a little child.  Now
go thou and summon the Greeks to the place of
assembly, that when thou hast renounced thy feud
with Agamemnon, thou mayest gird thee with might
and go forth to battle."  Then she brought nectar
and ambrosia, and embalmed therewith the body
of Patroclus, that his flesh might remain sound
and whole.
</p>

<p>
But Achilles strode rapidly along the strand,
shouting as he went to call the people to the assembly.
And forthwith from every tent the multitude came
flocking, and not one remained behind, no, not
even those who pursued peaceful crafts, and were
not wont to take part in the councils of the armed
host.  For not one was willing to be absent from
that memorable meeting.
</p>

<p>
As he passed on, he overtook Odysseus and
Diomede, who were limping painfully along, leaning
on their spears; for they were still sore with
their wounds.  After a few words of greeting, he
left them to follow, and went forward to the place
where the chiefs were sitting round the throne
of Agamemnon, which was still vacant.  It was a
level spot, in the centre of a natural hollow, whose
sides rose gently, until they were closed by a
background of waving woods.  And now all the slopes
were black with a swarming multitude, armed and
unarmed, stout spearmen, and noisy rabble.  At
last Agamemnon was seen approaching, moving
slowly and with pain.  He took his seat on the
royal throne, and then a dead hush fell on all that
vast company, as Achilles rose in his place, and
began to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Great King," he said, "we are met to end the
lamentable feud which arose out of our quarrel for
the sake of the maid Briseis.  Would that she had
never been born, or had been stricken with sudden
death by the gentle shafts of Artemis, before ever
she had put enmity between me and thee!  So
would many a brave man have been alive and well
who now lies sleeping an iron sleep.  Yes, for
many a year to come the Greeks will speak of the
wrath of Achilles, and of him who was the cause.
But here it ends: my wrath is now aimed at
another mark, and once more I am thy faithful
friend and ally.  War, war without quarter or
mercy&mdash;that is all I ask for now.  Let us see if the
Trojans will hold their camp at our gates when
they stand beneath the shadow of my destroying
spear."
</p>

<p>
Right glad were the Greeks to learn that the
tremendous passions of Achilles were now enlisted
on their side.  But their joyful cries were changed
to murmurs of resentment when Agamemnon rose
to answer; for they saw in him the author of all
their disasters.  Signs of remorse and confusion
appeared in his face; and the first words of his
speech were heard with difficulty amidst the tumult.
"Friends and comrades in arms," he began, "I
beseech you to hear me with patience, while I make
confession of my fault.  I have sinned, I cannot
deny it, through the dread power of Ate,[<a id="chap19fn1text"></a><a href="#chap19fn1">1</a>] who
blinded my heart, and maimed my wits, on the day
when I took from Achilles his prize.  Ah! she is a
fearful goddess, this Ate, a fiend to vex mankind.
Soft is her tread, and her path lies on the heads of
men: unseen, unheard, she approaches, and enters
into the soul of him whom she has marked for ruin.
Once she dwelt among the gods in Olympus, but
she dared to lay her foul spells on Zeus himself, so
that he fell into grievous error; and when he learnt
how he had been deceived, he swore a mighty oath
that never again should that abhorred witch set
foot in the celestial abode.  So he caught her by
the hair, and flung her down to earth, to plague the
tribes of men.  And she it was who made me her
victim, whereby all this mischief befell.  But now
I am ready to make all good, and heal the wrong
which I have wrought.  And all the gifts which I
promised yesterday by the mouth of Odysseus are
thine, Achilles, without abatement of one jot.  Wait
awhile, before thou goest into battle, and my squires
shall bring them to thy tent."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap19fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap19fn1text">1</a>] A personification of moral blindness.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"As for the gifts," replied Achilles, "they are
thine to give or to withhold as thou choosest.  But
of that hereafter; for the present, I have work to
do which admits of no delay.  No more of talk, but
let us away to the field at once."
</p>

<p>
But here the voice of prudence intervened,
checking the fiery impetuosity of Achilles.  "Hear
me a moment, valiant prince," said Odysseus.
"We must not lead the people fasting to battle,
for an empty man hath little heart for the fight,
which methinks will be neither short nor easy to-day.
Let the people first eat their fill, for a man cannot
face the foe from dawn till eve without tasting meat.
However willing his spirit, his flesh is weak; his
limbs are soon overtaken with weariness, his mouth
is parched with thirst, and his knees totter as he
goes.  Therefore, I say, let us eat, and after that
to battle.  And thou, Achilles, shalt receive the
gifts of Agamemnon, and partake of a banquet of
honour with the other chieftains in his tent.  The
King knows what is fitting, and he cannot do less."
</p>

<p>
Agamemnon willingly assented, and was proceeding
to give the order to bring the gifts when
Achilles started up again, in eager protest against
this delay.
</p>

<p>
"Illustrious King," he said, "surely there will be
time enough to speak of these lesser matters when
we have humbled the pride of the Trojans, who
are waiting for us on the plain.  My friend lies
slaughtered, pierced by Hector's spear, and ye talk
to me of meat and drink!  By my will the whole
army should keep a solemn fast, until we have
washed out the stain on our honour in a sea of
blood, and then, after the great act of vengeance
is complete, we will feast and make merry.  I at
least will suffer no morsel or drop to pass my lips
as long as my comrade lies in my tent with his feet
to the door, and the women mourning round.  No;
far other thoughts fill my heart&mdash;blood and slaughter,
and the groans of dying men."
</p>

<p>
But these desperate counsels found no favour
with the veteran heads of the army, and a deep hum
of approval greeted the more sober eloquence of
Odysseus, who now rose again to reply.  "Mighty
son of Peleus," he said, "thou art stronger far than
I, and thy spear writes deadlier record on the
foemen's ranks; but I have lived longer than thou, and
seen more: bear with me, then, while I speak what
reason and experience hath taught me.  Soon weary
grows the hand which toils in war's barren harvest,
where the swathe is so thick, and the yield so
scanty when the day is done.  We cannot keep
a fast for every Greek that falls&mdash;where would be
the end?  The warrior's dirge is short, and he is
honoured enough if he is mourned for a day.  And
those who are left must eat, that they may have
strength to fight on the morrow.  To your tents,
then, every one!  And when ye have eaten, come
quickly, armed for the fight, and await no second
summons."
</p>

<p>
For all his fierce impatience, Achilles was
compelled to yield.  With great effort he controlled
himself while the gifts were brought, and the
ceremonies performed, with no circumstance of
solemnity omitted, to ratify the covenant of
forgiveness and reconciliation between him and
Agamemnon.  And so the first act in the great
drama of his wrath is concluded.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Seven youths of princely rank, attended by a long
train of bearers, were despatched to the tent of
Achilles, loaded with the costly gifts of atonement
from the King.  With them went Briseis, thus
returned to her former lord.  When she saw
Patroclus on the bed where he lay, she beat her
breast, and, embracing the cold body, burst into a
passion of weeping.  "Friend of my sorrow!" she
cried, "I left thee living, and I find thee dead.
Woe, and more woe, is all my portion.  When I
came hither, an orphaned captive, bereaved of all,
thou didst comfort me in my great affliction,
promising, when the war was over, to make me
Achilles' lawful wife.  Thy gentleness and thy
knightly courtesy shed balm upon my wounded
spirit, and now thou art gone, and my last comfort
is gone with thee."
</p>

<p>
So mourned Briseis, and all the captive ladies
wept afresh when they heard her, having cause
enough for tears, every one.  The sound of their
lamentation reached the ears of Achilles where
he sat, but he remained unmoved by the tragedy
of these lesser spirits, being absorbed in the sense
of his own great loss.  The tide of his passion had
ebbed again, leaving his heart cold and desolate.
His men brought him food and drink, but he
repulsed them sternly, and would touch nothing.
He thought of the happy past&mdash;when he and
Patroclus had partaken together of many a cheerful
meal&mdash;and then of the bitter present, when the
sight of bread and meat filled him with loathing.
He thought of his father Peleus, growing old in
his solitary home, waiting in sad expectation to
hear of his son's death, and of the young
Neoptolemus, his own child, growing up among strangers
in the island of Scyros.  "Lost, lost, all lost!" he
murmured; "I shall never see them again."
</p>

<p>
But the gods had not forgotten their favourite.
Zeus beheld him as he sat thus stricken and forlorn,
and sent Athene to inspire him with new comfort
and strength.  Unseen, she alighted at his side,
and fed him, though he knew it not, with heavenly
food, filling his heart with more than mortal vigour
and courage.  Meanwhile the clash of arms rang
through the camp as the Greeks marched out,
column after column, to battle, thick as autumnal
leaves, or hovering snowflakes in winter.  The
air seemed on fire with the flash of myriads of
spears, and the earth shook beneath the thunder
of their tread.
</p>

<p>
Roused by the sound, Achilles sprang to his
feet, and buckled on his corslet, and clasped the
greaves to his ankles.  Then he flung the sword
over his shoulder, and thrust his arm through the
strap of his shield, which shone like the full-orbed
moon, or a beaconlight blazing afar over a stormy
sea.  Last of all, he lifted his mighty helmet, with
its nodding, golden plume, and set it on his head.
And now, being arrayed in his harness from head
to foot, he raised himself to his towering height, and
stretched his fleet limbs, to prove the armour; and
it became unto him as wings, making him lighter
and nimbler than ever before.
</p>

<p>
Grasping in his right hand his spear&mdash;the mighty
Pelian ash, pointed with death&mdash;he went forth
before the tent, where Automedon stood waiting
with his car.  "Now hear me, ye children of the
wind!" he cried, addressing his steeds, "see that
ye play me not false to-day, as when ye left Patroclus
dead on the field, and came back with an empty car."
</p>

<p>
Then there befell a wondrous thing; for the good
steed Xanthus, drooping low his head, answered
with a human voice, and spake thus unto his master:
"Yea, we will carry thee safe back, most dread
Achilles, when the fight is o'er.  It was by no
sloth or tardiness of ours that thy brave comrade
met his death; that deed was wrought by the hand
of Apollo, using Hector as his instrument&mdash;even as
thou too shalt be cut off by a human weapon, but
by no human power."
</p>

<p>
So spake the immortal courser, for the first and
the last time; for fate suffered it not again.  And
Achilles answered him, and said: "Waste not
thy prophecies on me, good steed!  I know my
fate&mdash;death on the battlefield, far from my home:
but ere that hour comes I will send many a Trojan
to herald my coming among the dead."
</p>

<p>
Then, shouting his dread battle-cry, he sprang
into his car, and drove headlong to the front.
</p>

<h3>
Achilles in the Battlefield
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
By high permission of all-ruling Jove the gods
were now free to take part in the war, and
they all with one accord came down from
Olympus to mingle with the fray.  Only Zeus
remained behind, as supreme arbiter of the final
issue.  All the rest took sides with the Greeks or
Trojans, and five rival pairs confronted each other
in the field&mdash;Poseidon found a match in Apollo,
the great ally of the Trojans&mdash;Hera, who loved
the Greeks like a mother, was confronted by the
archer-goddess Artemis&mdash;against Athene stood
Ares, whose fickle mind now inclined to the
Trojans&mdash;Hermes, who favoured the Greeks, was
met on the other side by Leto, the mother of
Artemis and Apollo&mdash;and lastly HephÃ¦stus and
Scamander, the opposing powers of fire and water,
took the field, the former for the Greeks, the latter
for the Trojans.
</p>

<p>
All nature was in uproar as these tremendous
allies entered the scene of conflict.  Earth shook,
and the mountains reeled to their foundations, and
the towers of Troy and the Grecian ships reeled as
in an earthquake.  Then trembling came upon
Hades, the monarch of the dead, and leaping from
his throne he cried aloud in fear, lest the earth, rent
by Poseidon's trident, should disclose to mortal and
immortal eyes the dank and dreary mansions of
the dead, which even the gods abhor.
</p>

<p>
Far in front of the Grecian line was seen the
glittering form of Achilles, who scanned the Trojan
ranks like a lion who seeks his prey, having but one
thought, but one aim&mdash;to meet Hector, and slay
him.  But Hector's hour was not yet come, for
Apollo stood near to shield him from his great
enemy, and delay the fatal stroke which sooner or
later must lay him low.  And first the god put it
into the heart of Ã†neas to defy Achilles to battle,
and gave him unwonted courage and strength,
that he might not flinch in that fearful encounter.
Then Ã†neas heard a voice which whispered within
him, and seemed to say: "Art thou not the son of
Aphrodite, who is the daughter of supreme Jove?
Why fearest thou then this upstart child of Thetis,
of far meaner lineage than thine?  Go face him,
and let him learn that neither are the Trojans
forsaken of heaven."
</p>

<p>
So between the advancing lines they met, both
sons of gods, but far different in their fate.  At
first Achilles had not observed his approach, but
stalked, heedless of all lesser foes, before the
embattled host of Troy, like a lion bent on ravage,
against whom a whole township is gathered, with
purpose to slay him and at first he goes on his
way, disdaining the menaces of that rabble
rout&mdash;but then, being pricked by the point of a random
spear, he gathers himself, foaming and gnashing
his teeth, for the spring, and his mighty spirit
groans within him, and he lashes his flanks on
both sides with his tail, goading himself to
battle&mdash;then glaring and roaring he launches his vast
weight at the foe, resolved to kill or be killed&mdash;so
sprang Achilles against Ã†neas, in wrath at his
presumption.
</p>

<p>
"What wouldst thou of me, Ã†neas?" he cried,
in disdainful mood.  "Have the Trojans promised
thee a fair estate, if thou take my life?  Or hopest
thou, perchance, to sit in the seat of Priam, if thou
accomplish this great deed?  I thought thou hadst
had enough of me and my spear.  Hast thou forgotten
when I chased thee through the glades of Ida,
having caught thee alone among the grazing herds?
Then didst thou never turn thy head to look back,
until thou hadst reached the shelter of a fenced
city.  And I sacked the city, and led captive the
women; but thou didst escape me again, through
the special mercy of Zeus.  Go back, vain man,
and join the press of thy comrades or thou shalt
not escape me now.
</p>

<p>
"Who art thou?" answered Ã†neas, undaunted,
"that thinkest to affright me with boastful words,
as if I were a witless boy?  Know, proud man,
that I am of higher descent than thine, for in my
veins flows the royal blood of Dardanus, mingled
with the blood of gods.  Go to, let us wrangle no
more like women in the market-place, but decide
the quarrel with our spears."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, he cast his spear, which struck with
strong impact against the shield of Achilles; and
he, when he felt the shock, held the shield away
from his body, fearing that the point would pass
through and reach his flesh.  But immortal armour
is not easy to be pierced by mortal weapons, and
the spear dropped harmless to the earth.  Then
Achilles flung in his turn, and the spear tore its
way through the upper rim of Ã†neas' shield: and
he, stooping low, heard the rush of the mighty
lance, as it flew over his head, and buried itself
in the ground behind him.  Having thus both
missed their cast, they prepared to renew the struggle
hand to hand.  Achilles drew his sword, and rushed
to the encounter with a fierce cry: while Ã†neas
lifted a heavy stone, and stood ready to hurl it as
his antagonist drew near.
</p>

<p>
But that combat, which must have ended fatally
for the Trojan, was not destined to be fought out
to its end.  "Behold," said Poseidon, who was
watching the unequal duel, to Hera, who sat near
him, "my spirit is troubled because of Ã†neas,
whom his own rashness, and the evil counsels of
Apollo, are leading to his doom.  But this must
not be: he is reserved for a better fate, which shall
be accomplished after the towers of Troy have been
levelled with the dust.  In him shall the line of
Dardanus be preserved, and from him shall be born
a mighty race, to found a new empire on the ruins
of the old."[<a id="chap20fn1text"></a><a href="#chap20fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap20fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap20fn1text">1</a>] These lines contain the germ of the <i>Ã†neid</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Do as thou wilt," answered Hera.  "As for me,
I have sworn a great oath that I will never save a
Trojan from perishing, no, not in the last fatal hour
when Troy shall be consumed with fire."
</p>

<p>
When Poseidon heard that, he went and stood
between the fighting champions; and on the eyes
of Achilles he shed a thick darkness, that he might
not see what was done.  Then he drew the spear
from the shield of Ã†neas, and threw it at Achilles'
feet; and catching up the Trojan prince in his
hand he bore him aloft over the heads of the
Greeks and Trojans, until he reached the utmost
verge of the battlefield.  There he set him down,
and, becoming visible in all his divine majesty,
addressed him in these solemn words of warning:
"Ã†neas, what put this mad thought into thy
heart, to fight against Achilles, who is both stronger
than thou and dearer to the gods?  Tempt not thy
fate again, but when thou meetest him avoid his
spear; and after he is slain, then mayest thou
boldly encounter the bravest of the Greeks, for
no other hath power to do thee hurt."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
When the darkness fell from the eyes of Achilles
he looked round about him, and saw his spear
lying at his feet, but sought in vain for Ã†neas.
"What wonder is this?" he said to himself; "the
spear is returned to me, but mine enemy is vanished.
Surely the gods love him also, though I deemed
that he boasted idly.  Let him go!  It will be long
before he desires to face me again."
</p>

<p>
Then, shouting to the Greeks to support him,
he fell upon the main body of the Trojans, seeking
everywhere for Hector; and finding him not (for
Apollo as yet withheld the Trojan patriot from his
eyes) he began to deal out indiscriminate slaughter
wherever he went.  A brave Lycian, the son of a
mountain nymph, who rushed to attack him, was
his first victim; with one blow of that tremendous
spear his head was shattered as with a battering-ram,
and he fell beneath the feet of the horses, and
the wheels of the car passed over his body.
</p>

<p>
Among the many who went to swell the list of
the slain that day was Polydorus, a favourite son
of Priam, who loved him as his youngest born, and
who had forbidden him to go into battle.  But
he, trusting in the speed of his feet, had come to
the field the day before, and now appeared in the
van of the Trojans, a graceful and agile youth,
lovely and pleasant to behold.  But as he pursued
his gay career a javelin from the hand of Achilles
pierced his armour at the waist, and he fell, torn
in the midst by a hideous wound.
</p>

<p>
Hector saw his brother fall, and full of rage and
grief sprang forward to avenge his death.  When
Achilles saw his great enemy at last within his
reach he leapt towards him with a loud and
exultant cry: "Draw near, and pay the price of
my comrade, whom thou hast slain!"  "Proud
man, I fear thee not," answered Hector,
undismayed: "I know that thou art far mightier than
I, but nevertheless I defy thee, and trust that
heaven will lend keenness to my spear."
</p>

<p>
But the end was not yet.  Apollo intervened
to save the gallant Trojan, and bore him away
wrapped in a cloud of darkness.  Three times
Achilles struck, and three times his spear smote
idly on the empty air.  "Thou dog!" he cried at
last, finding his efforts unavailing, "Thou hast
avoided me now, but I will destroy thee yet, for
I have friends among the gods as well as thou.
Till then, let my vengeance fall upon thy countrymen."
</p>

<p>
And as a fire rages in a forest on a mountainside,
licking up the underwood, and thrusting out
its red fangs to devour the tall trees, so raged
Pelides in the fury of slaughter, and the earth ran
red with blood.  And as two broad-browed steers
move to and fro on a threshing-floor, treading
out the corn, so trampled the steeds of Achilles
on corpses and shields and broken armour, as he
passed on, raining wounds and death on every side.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The Trojan army was now split into two
divisions, one of which was flying across the plain
towards the city, while Achilles drove the other
before him towards the banks of Scamander.  Into
the stream they flocked, without pausing in their
flight, like a cloud of locusts driven by a fire to seek
refuge in the nearest water; and Scamander's bed
was choked by a huddled multitude of horses and men.
</p>

<p>
Leaning his spear against a plane-tree, Achilles
leapt into the river, sword in hand, and struck right
and left, until the waters were crimsoned with
blood.  And as a shoal of fish flies before the
onset of a dolphin, seeking the shallow waters near
the shore, so shrank the Trojans from the sword
of Achilles, and hid themselves under the arching
banks.  Then he remembered his promise to
Patroclus, and, choosing twelve comely youths from
that panic-stricken throng, he drove them before
him, and gave them, bound, to his men to be brought
alive to the ships.  This done, he went back to
continue the work of slaughter; and as he reached
the river's brink he saw a Trojan, who had just
left the water, and was preparing to fly towards the
city.  "Aha! are we met again?" cried Achilles,
recognising in the fugitive a certain Lycaon, one of
the numerous family of Priam, whom once before
he had taken prisoner, having caught him during
a night foray, when the luckless youth was busy
cutting the young shoots of the olive, to make a
rim for a chariot.  On that occasion he had spared
his life, and sold him into captivity to the King
of Lemnos, from whom he had been ransomed
by a friend of Priam, and so found his way back
to Troy.  For eleven days since his return from
Lemnos he had taken his pleasure among his
friends, and on the twelfth his fate threw him
into the hands of Achilles for the second and
last time.
</p>

<p>
Lycaon had flung away shield and helmet and
spear, that he might be lightened in the race for
his life.  But Achilles was upon him before he was
aware, threatening him with uplifted spear.  "So
thou hast returned from Lemnos?" he said
mockingly.  "We will now send thee on a longer
journey, and we will see if thou come back again
this time."  The wretched youth flung himself
down, and avoiding the spear-point crawled on his
knees to Achilles, and clinging to him said: "Have
pity on me, great warrior, and have respect for the
sacred tie between host and guest; for I was thy
guest, illustrious chieftain, and have broken bread
under thy roof, on the day when thou madest me
captive.  Thou hast no cause to hate me, for I was
not born of the same mother as Hector, who slew
thy friend."
</p>

<p>
But there was no sign of relenting in the stern
face which was bent over him, and he received a
foretaste of the pangs of death as he heard the
answer of Achilles.  "Talk not to me," said he,
"of ransom or redemption.  As long as Patroclus
was alive I was well pleased to make prisoners and
release them for a price, but now not one shall
escape of all those who fall into my hands, and
least of all the sons of Priam.  Thou must die,
my friend!  Why seems it to thee so hard?
Patroclus met his fate with the rest, and he was
a far better man than thou art.  Look upon me;
am I not a tall and proper man?  Yet the shadow
of death is creeping nearer and ever nearer to me,
and soon the hour of my doom shall strike, whether
at morn, or at noon, or at eventide."
</p>

<p>
At these words Lycaon's heart froze within him,
and leaving hold of the spear he sank down on
his knees, stretching out both his hands in mute
entreaty.  Then Achilles lifted up his sword, and
clove him to the waist, and seizing his body by
the foot flung it into the river.  "Lie there among
the fishes!" cried that ruthless man: "They will
tend thy wounds, until Scamander bears thee to the
deep, where thou shalt find fit burial in some sea
monster's maw.  Death, death to all your accursed
race!  Naught shall avail you your silver-eddying
stream, to whose deity ye offer sacrifice of bulls
and horses, but ye shall pay threefold and fourfold
the debt of blood which ye owe me for the lives of
the Greeks whom ye have slain."
</p>

<p>
The river-god heard him, and, waxing exceeding
wroth, began to consider how he should stop the
murderous career of Achilles.  And while he was
still debating within himself Achilles was
confronted by AsteropÃ¦us, a brave Thracian chieftain,
and the son of the presiding deity of Axius, a broad
and noble stream.  This man now barred the way
of Achilles, brandishing a spear in each hand.
"Whence and what art thou?" cried Achilles,
amazed that anyone should dare to oppose him;
for he knew not that Scamander had steeled the
heart of AsteropÃ¦us to do this deed.  "Art thou
weary of thy life?" he asked again, as the Thracian
still came on.  "I will tell thee what I am,"
answered AsteropÃ¦us boldly: "I am the son of
a deity, even as thou art, and my father was Axius,
the fairest river on earth.  Now let us fight, great
son of Thetis."
</p>

<p>
With that he flung both spears at once, for he
was equally skilled with both hands; and one of
the spears struck against the shield of Achilles, but
could not penetrate it, while the other grazed his
right arm, and drew blood.  Then Achilles hurled
his spear, which missed AsteropÃ¦us, and buried
itself to half its length in the river bank.
AsteropÃ¦us grasped the shaft, and strove with all his
might to tear the weapon from the ground.  Failing
in this, he next tried to break it in the middle, to
use as a club; but by this time Achilles was upon
him, and with one stroke of his sword clove him
almost in twain.  "Thou hast found thy match, thou
river's brood!" he cried, stripping off the bloodstained
armour.  "Fool, that comparest thyself with me,
whose fathers sprang in a direct line from Jove!
He, methinks, is mightier than any river, yea,
mightier than Oceanus, the great father of floods,
who trembles before the red lightning, and the
voice of the thunder, when it crashes through
the skies."
</p>

<p>
So saying he lightly plucked out the embedded
spear, and went in pursuit of the men of AsteropÃ¦us,
who were crouching in terror along the river's
banks.  Seven of them he slew, and was about
to continue the work of carnage when he received
a check.  From the depths of the stream a
mysterious voice arose, in tones of protest and
complaint: "Achilles, thine arm is exceeding
mighty, and thy prowess more than mortal; for
the gods are ever near to aid thee.  If Zeus hath
given thee leave to slaughter all the Trojans, at least
drive them away from my bed and butcher them
on the plain.  My waters are choked with corpses,
and I cannot roll my current any longer towards
the holy sea, because my channel is straitened
by the multitude of thy miserable victims.  Give
place, great chieftain, and cumber me no more."
</p>

<p>
"It shall be as thou sayest, thou god revered,"
answered Achilles.  "But suffer me yet a little while
until my task is done."  And without further parley
he sprang down again into the river bed.  Then the
god was wroth, and prepared to expel that daring
intruder from his domain.  He gathered all his
waters, which rose up in surging billows, and washed
the corpses ashore; and to the living he gave shelter,
hiding them away in great hollow eddies.  Then,
collecting himself in one towering wave, he rushed
upon Achilles, buffeting his shield, and eating away
the ground under his feet.  Achilles grasped an
elm, a tall and stately tree, and clung to it for
support; but the torrent had undermined its roots,
and the next moment it fell, tearing a huge gap in
the bank, and damming back the waters with its
leafy boughs.  Then he leaped from the yellow,
swirling torrent, and darted across the plain in
head-long flight; for he was sore afraid.  But Scamander
followed hard at his heels, roaring and arching his
crest.  In vain Achilles ran and doubled, and
doubled and ran; the river pursued him everywhere,
until his strength began to fail him; and if he stood
still for a moment the waves rose instantly as high
as his shoulders, threatening to swallow him up.
Then he gave himself up for lost, and with a groan
he gazed upward to the broad heaven, and uttered
this despairing cry for help: "O all ye gods, is this
then to be my end?  Am I to perish thus, drowned
like some nameless churl, who is swept away while
crossing a ford in winter?"
</p>

<p>
Some friendly power heard his wild appeal, and
lent him new strength and courage to continue the
struggle.  So on he panted across the plain, which
by this time was covered with floating corpses,
helmets, and shields.  But Scamander raged the
more furiously when he saw his prey still eluding
his clutch, and he called aloud to Simocis, his
brother stream, to join in the pursuit.  And Simocis
answered to his call, and mustered all his waters
from every fountainhead and every tributary stream.
Then the twin rivers roared together in unison, and
came down upon him, battering him with uprooted
trees and rolling rocks, which they swept along in
their course, "We will quell thee," they shouted,
"thou godless man, for all thy beauty and thy
strength, and thou and thy gleaming panoply shall
be wrapped in a thick shroud of mud, at the bottom
of our blackest and deepest pool.  Thy dirge shall
be sung by our rolling waters, and thy monument
none shall behold."
</p>

<p>
Achilles was now in extremity, and would surely
have ended as ignobly as the river-god had said, if
another power had not come to his aid.  "Where
art thou, my son, HephÃ¦stus?" cried Hera, seeing
that Achilles could hold out no longer.  "Thou art
he who should save our champion in this strait, for
thou and Scamander are natural enemies.  Haste
thee to the rescue, armed with thy proper element;
and I will summon the blasts of the West and the
South to fan thy flames.  Let fire fight with water,
and spare not, nor cease thy fury until I give thee
the signal to desist."
</p>

<p>
HephÃ¦stus made haste to obey his mother, and
forthwith he caused a sheet of fire to sweep across
the plain, burning the corpses, and drying up the
flood.  Then he turned his flames upon the river
himself, and all the trees which fringed his
banks&mdash;elms, and willows, and plane-trees&mdash;were soon
ablaze.  Speedily the fire spread to the rushes and
water plants, and at last the very waters began to
grow hot, so that the fishes leapt into the air in their
agony, and Scamander himself was in dire distress.
</p>

<p>
"It is enough," he cried, yielding to a superior power.
"Torment me no more, HephÃ¦stus!  Let Achilles
destroy the whole nation of Trojans, if he will&mdash;I
will not seek to prevent him."
</p>

<p>
By this time the waters were beginning to boil
and bubble, and clouds of steam rose into the air.
Seeing that the river was thoroughly quelled, Hera
gave the signal, and HephÃ¦stus drew off his forces,
and left Scamander in peace.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
After his escape from the river, Achilles went in
pursuit of the other Trojans, who had fallen back
towards the town.  Then began a second rout, and
a second slaughter, and Priam, who was watching
the field from his citadel, soon beheld the whole
remnant of the Trojan army flying before Achilles
towards the city.  With a cry of alarm he hastened
down to the gates, and gave directions to the
warders to draw bolt and bar, and admit the flying
multitude.  "But stand ready," he said, "to make
all fast, as soon as the people are safe within, for
fear lest this terrible man should enter the town."
</p>

<p>
The warders did as they were bidden, and held
the gates ready; and before long the first of the
fugitives came panting in, their lips parched with
thirst, and their armour powdered with dust.
</p>

<p>
Still unsated with slaughter, Achilles came on
in hot pursuit, and Priam's fears might have been
realised if Agenor, a young Trojan noble, had not
been inspired by Apollo with sudden courage, which
prompted him to cross the destroyer's path.  "I
will face this man," he said, halting from his flight.
"He too is of mortal flesh, and has but one life
to lose.  I will face him, though Zeus fight on his
side."
</p>

<p>
As a leopard comes forth from his thick covert to
meet the hunter, when he hears the baying of the
hounds, and, even though sorely wounded, fights on
till he is slain, so stood Agenor to meet Achilles,
with shield on breast, and spear poised for the
throw.  "Thou thoughtest to have taken Troy this
day," he cried.  "Thou fool!  This deed is not for
thee; thou shall not read to the end the story of
her woes, but here, on this spot, I will end thy life
of blood."
</p>

<p>
With that he cast his spear, which struck him on
the greave above the knee, but rebounded from the
tempered metal; but before Achilles could return
the attack Apollo removed Agenor from his reach,
and putting on the likeness of Agenor fled away
towards the river, luring Achilles after him.  The
Trojans were thus given time to make good their
escape, and the city was soon filled with a
frightened and disordered host, thankful to have
escaped with bare life.  All along the battlements
were seen groups of exhausted men, who wiped the
sweat from their brows, and drank deep draughts
of wine to quench their burning thirst.  Only one
was left outside: This was Hector, who remained
of his own free will, resolved to decide the issue in
single combat with Achilles.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
The Death of Hector
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Having achieved his purpose, Apollo now
resumed his own shape, and halting before
Achilles thus addressed him: "Knowest
thou not me, Achilles?  See, the Trojans are safe
from thy fury, gathered within their gates.  What
wouldst thou have?  Is it my life thou seekest?
Cease, presumptuous mortal, and remember what
thou art!"
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast foiled me, archer-god," answered
Achilles, perceiving that he had been tricked.
"Thou hast robbed me of my prey, or many
another Trojan would have bitten the dust.  I
would make thee rue this wrong to mine honour
had I but the power."  Then, like a fiery courser
starting in the race, he sped away towards the city,
bent on high designs.  Like the red rays of that
sultry star whose rising heralds in the fierce heat
of summer, the season of drought and fever, such
was the bright but fearful gleam which flashed
from his armour as he ran.
</p>

<p>
Priam was the first who saw that ill-omened ray,
from the place where he stood, on the wall above
the gate.  And when he marked the destroyer's
approach he groaned aloud, and beat his head, and
then, stretching out his hands over the battlements,
thus spake unto Hector, beseeching him earnestly,
and with tears: "O Hector, my son, my son,
remain not there, thus deserted and alone, to abide
the coming of that fearful man, seeing that he is
mightier far than thou.  He hath robbed me of
many a noble son, whom he hath killed or sold into
captivity in distant isles.  Spare me this last and
bitterest blow!  Fling not thy life away, to bring
glory on Pelides, and on us sorrow and loss
unspeakable.  Alas! will it never cease, the storm of
misery which rains without pause on this white,
distracted head!  No, I see them flocking, the
spectres of worse evils yet to come, sorrow on
sorrow, and woe on woe&mdash;murdered sons and
daughters dragged into bondage, a violated home,
and little children dashed to the ground in the fury
of battle.  Last scene of all&mdash;an old man slaughtered
on his own hearthstone, and the dogs who fed at
his table and guarded his door now maddened by
sights and sounds of horror, and lapping his blood!"
</p>

<p>
The old man broke off, overpowered by the dark
vision which his fancy had conjured up; and the
appeal was taken up by Hecuba, the venerable
Queen of Troy.  "By this breast which nourished
thee," she cried, "by the sacred name of mother,
I implore thee to abandon thy rash purpose.  Fly
from this man, or he will slay thee, and dogs will
devour thy flesh in the Grecian camp."
</p>

<p>
But all the anguished entreaties of his father
and mother had no power to shake the resolution
of Hector.  He could not go back now; he had
rejected with scorn the prudent advice which
Polydamas had given the night before, and had
thereby caused the death of a legion of Trojans.
How could he face the taunts of the women whom
his rashness had made widows, and the mute
reproaches of the children now orphaned by his act?
He had openly defied Achilles, and it was too
late to recall the challenge.  A wild plan crossed
his mind, only to be instantly rejected: should he
lay aside shield, and helmet, and spear, and go
unarmed to Achilles, offering to make an end of
this lamentable war at the cost of half the city's
goods, and the free restitution of Helen with all
her wealth?  "No," he said, convinced at once of
the desperate folly of such an enterprise: "I should
then be guilty of self-murder: he would butcher me
without mercy, before I had time to utter a word.
This is no time for gentle parley, as between maid
and youth sitting in soft dalliance under rock or
tree: I must meet him with sword and spear, for
victory or death."
</p>

<p>
Achilles was now close at hand, with the mighty
Pelian ash swaying on his right shoulder, and his
armour blazing like the light of the rising sun.
When Hector saw him advancing, like an incarnate
spirit of vengeance, all his heroic resolves forsook
him, and seized with sudden terror he turned and
fled.  And as a falcon swoops down on a hare, and
pounces, and pounces again, as his victim leaps
and doubles, to escape from the fatal clutch, so
Achilles darted after Hector, following all the turns
and windings of his flight.  Past a low hill they
went, whence the Trojan scout had espied the
advance of the Greeks not many days before, and
past the wild fig-tree, following a beaten road,
which led to two fair springs, the double source of
eddying Scamander.  One of the springs is of hot
water, and a cloud of steam hangs over it, like the
smoke of a burning fire; but the other is cold as
ice.  Here were broad washing-pits, lined with
stone, in which the wives and daughters were wont
to tread the clothes, in the old peaceful days, before
ever the Greeks had landed on the shores of Troy.
Leaving these behind them, they sped on, and still
on, pursuer and pursued.  Noble was the quarry,
but the hunter was nobler far, and never before had
he run in so keen a chase.  Like mettled steeds,
which strive for the mastery, where the prize is a
vessel of gold or of silver, they flew; but here they
were running for a far higher stake, even the very
life of Troy's bravest son.
</p>

<p>
Three times they compassed the whole circuit of
the walls, and again and again Hector tried to draw
his pursuer within range of the spears of the Trojans
who lined the battlements; but each time his effort
was defeated by Achilles, who barred his way to
the city, and drove him back into the open plain.
</p>

<p>
As one who pursues his enemy in a dream, and
cannot catch him, though he seems ever within
reach, so was Achilles ever baffled, when he strove
to overtake Hector, and Hector, when he strove to
escape.  All the Greeks stood near in their ranks,
watching the chase&mdash;and many a time a spear was
levelled at Hector, to strike him down; but Achilles
beckoned with his hand, and forbade his comrades
to come between him and his victim.
</p>

<p>
For the fourth time they came to the place of
the washing-pits, and here by mutual consent they
paused to draw breath; for both were sore spent with
running, and could not go a step farther.  As Achilles
stood panting, and leaning on his spear, Athene
drew near to him, unseen of all the rest, and said:
"He cannot escape us now, though Apollo should
grovel in the dust at the feet of Zeus, begging for his
life.  Remain awhile and recover thy strength, and
I will go and persuade him to fight thee face to face."
</p>

<p>
About an arrow's flight distant, Hector had come
to a standstill, and drooped heavily, resting his hands
on his knees, half strangled by his efforts to breathe.
Suddenly, to his amazement, he saw Deiphobus,
his brother, standing by his side, and heard the
familiar tones of his voice.  "Dear brother," said
Deiphobus, "thou art hard beset, and driven to
bay by this fierce son of Peleus.  But lo!  I am here
to aid thee, and I will not fail thee in this strait."
</p>

<p>
"Deiphobus," answered Hector, "thou wert
ever dearest to me of all the sons whom Hecuba
bore to Priam: but now thou art dear and honoured
too, since alone of all my nation thou hast dared to
leave the shelter of the walls."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," answered the pretended Deiphobus, "my
mother and my father, and all my friends, strove
to hold me back; but my heart yearned towards
thee in thy mortal need.  But come with me, and
together we will try the fortune of war.  Go thou
first, and I will follow."
</p>

<p>
Hector accordingly advanced to meet Achilles,
who was already moving towards him.  "I will fly
thee no more," he said, when they were within a
spear's cast of each other, "I will either slay thee,
or be slain.  But let us first make a covenant, and
call the gods to witness it: swear thou that, if I fall,
thou wilt restore my body and my armour to the
Trojans&mdash;and I will swear to do the like by thee."
</p>

<p>
"Talk not to me of covenants, thou villain!"
answered Achilles fiercely.  "As there is no treaty
possible between lions and men, no concord between
wolves and lambs, but only fear and hatred, so is there
hate unending between me and thee, which naught
but death may cancel or abate.  Summon up all thy
manhood, and prepare to pay the price of my
comrades whom thou hast slain."
</p>

<p>
This said he poised and flung his spear; but
Hector stooped low, and the spear flew over his
head, and sank deep into the earth.  Unobserved
by Hector, Athene drew it out, and gave it back
to Achilles.  "Take now my spear!" shouted the
Trojan, "take it to thy heart, thou braggart, that
thinkest to dismay me with boastful words!"  The
weapon flew straight to its mark, and, striking the
centre of Achilles' shield, rebounded to a distance,
and fell rattling on the ground.  Then Hector
called anxiously to Deiphobus, bidding him bring
another lance.  But no answer came, for the real
Deiphobus was safe behind the walls, and he who
had appeared to Hector was a false Deiphobus,
concealing the person of Athene.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!  I have been deceived," said Hector.
"My last bolt is shot, and my fate summons me to
death.  Let me not die inglorious and without a
struggle, but in such wise that I shall be named
with honour by generations yet unborn."
</p>

<p>
Then, drawing his sword, he rushed upon Achilles,
who came on slowly, towering above the rampart
of his shield, nodding his golden plumes and
brandishing high his spear, whose point twinkled and
flashed like the light of the evening star.  Scanning
every joint in Hector's armour, at last Achilles
spied a point, between the shoulder-blade and the
neck, which was undefended; and at this mark he
hurled his spear with all his force and pierced him
through the neck.  But the passage of his voice
was left untouched, so that he was still able to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast paid thy debt to Patroclus," said
Achilles, standing over his fallen enemy, "and now
thou shalt pay the usury.  Dogs and vultures shall
give thee burial, but he shall lie in an honoured tomb."
</p>

<p>
"By thy life," answered Hector faintly, "by thy
father's name, I implore thee, give not my body to
be devoured by dogs, but restore it to my friends,
who will pay thee a heavy ransom, that I may
receive my due in death."
</p>

<p>
"Thou dog!" replied Achilles, with a furious
look, "talk not of thy dues, nor name my father to
me!  Would that I could find it in my heart to
carve and devour thy flesh, as surely as thou shalt
not escape the hounds and vultures, no, not if Priam
were to offer thy weight in gold, after what thou
hast done unto me and mine."
</p>

<p>
"I knew that I should not persuade thee," said
Hector, with his dying breath.  "Thou hast a heart
of iron.  But vengeance shall reach thee in the day
when Apollo and Paris shall subdue thee at the
gates of Troy."
</p>

<p>
As he uttered this prophecy a shudder ran
through his limbs, and the gallant spirit fled to the
land of shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Die!" said Achilles, as Hector uttered his last
sigh.  "As for me, I am prepared to meet my fate
whensoever heaven wills its accomplishment."
</p>

<p>
Then he drew out his spear, and laying it aside,
began to strip off the armour which Hector had
taken from Patroclus.  And the Greeks came
crowding round, to gaze on the beauty and stature
of Hector, and stab the helpless body with their
spears.  Far other had he seemed to them when
he came with fire and sword to burn their ships,
and fill their camp with slaughter!
</p>

<p>
When Achilles had finished stripping the corpse,
he stood up and spoke thus to the assembled host:
"Princes and counsellors of the Greeks, now that
the gods have granted us to slay this mighty
champion, who hath done us more harm than all
the rest together, shall we not advance in full force
against the city, and end the war at one bold
stroke?  But alas! what am I saying?  We have
another and a sadder duty to perform.  Patroclus
lies among the ships, unburied, unwept, and shall I
forget him in this hour of triumph?  No; not in
the hour of death, not in the grave itself, which
brings, they say, oblivion to all, shall my love for
him grow cold.  Therefore follow me, sirs, to the
ships, and raise the song of victory.  We have gained
great glory, we have slain Troy's chief defender, to
whom all the Trojans prayed as to a god."
</p>

<p>
Then, in fulfilment of his horrible menaces,
he prepared to take hideous vengeance on his
slaughtered enemy.  Stooping down he pierced
the dead man's feet from heel to ankle, and passed
a leathern thong through the holes; then he made
fast the thong behind the chariot, and, taking up
the armour, he sprang into the driver's place, and
lashed his horses to a gallop.  So amid a swirling
cloud of dust the fallen hero was dragged along,
with his dark locks streaming, and that comely
head marred and defiled; and Zeus delivered him
to injury and outrage at the hands of his enemies
in his own native land.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
But what were the feelings of the Trojans
watching on the walls when they saw their great
champion fall, and with what eyes did the aged king and
the fond mother behold their Hector, their joy and
pride, and chief defence, butchered, mutilated, and
dragged through the dust!  Through all the city
arose a great cry of lamentation, and such horror
was written on every face as if the Greeks had
carried Troy by storm, and were filling her streets
with fire and slaughter.  Priam was hardly
restrained from going forth at once, with the
purpose of entering the Grecian camp, and
throwing himself at the feet of Achilles.
</p>

<p>
But there was another, bound by an even nearer
and dearer tie to the slain, who was the last to
learn the fearful news.  This was Andromache,
Hector's wife, who was sitting at her loom in the
retirement of her chamber, weaving a piece of
flowered tapestry.  Presently she left her task, and
calling her handmaids bade them prepare the bath
for their master against his return from battle.
Her face was cheerful and serene, and she smiled
as she thought of the happy meeting which seemed
so near.  But in the midst of these pleasant
household cares a dreadful sound reached her ears&mdash;a
shrill note, as of women shrieking, mingled with
the deeper groans of men.  "Hark!" she said,
turning deadly pale, and dropping the shuttle,
which she had been holding in her hand: "What
mean these cries?"  Then, as she paused again to
listen, she heard the voice of Hecuba, raised in
loud anguish above the rest.  With a woman's
quick instinct she divined that the worst had
befallen her, and shrieking: "Hector, my Hector,
is slain!" she hastened, with ashy cheeks, and
tottering knees, to the walls.  The crowd fell back
at her approach, and every voice was hushed when
they saw her bending over the battlements, and
gazing with wild eyes across the plain.  Then she
saw Achilles in full career towards the ships,
dragging her husband's body behind his car.  At
that sight she gave one gasping cry, and reeling
back fell swooning into the arms of her
kinswomen who were standing ready to aid.  Thus for
awhile she lay, motionless and lifeless, with her
long hair, escaped from its bands, streaming about
her.  At last she drew a deep, sobbing breath, and
opening her eyes looked into the anxious faces bent
over her.  Then the full consciousness of her loss
rushed back upon her in a bitter flood, and
breaking from the gentle hands which held her she
made as if she would fling herself down from the
battlements.  She was prevented by kindly force,
and led away, moaning and weeping, to her
widowed home.

<h3>
The Funeral Games of Patroclus
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
When Achilles reached the camp, he
commanded his men to remain under arms,
and led the whole company, with horses
and with chariots, in solemn procession, three times
round the couch on which the dead Patroclus lay.
When the strange rite was ended, the couch, which
had been brought out for this purpose, was carried
back with its burden to the tent, and they unyoked
their horses, and prepared to take their supper.
Hector's body was flung into a corner, where it lay
exposed to the burning sun, and the cold dews of night.
Achilles feasted his men bountifully, and then went,
attended by a special guard of honour, to partake of
a banquet in the royal tent.  Being invited to refresh
himself with a bath, he stubbornly refused, and swore
a great oath that he would never wash the stains
of battle from his person until Patroclus had been
buried with all the pomp of woe.  At the banquet
he seemed ill at ease, and as soon as it was ended
he prayed his kingly host to have him excused, and
went back to the quarters of the Myrmidons.
</p>

<p>
Night came down, and silence fell on the
sleeping camp.  Achilles had not sought his bed, but
had laid himself down on the sand, in a clear space,
where the billows broke at his feet.  There sleep
soon overtook him, stilling the dull ache of sorrow;
for his limbs were very weary, after that tremendous
fight, and still more tremendous race.  And as he
slept the ghost of Patroclus came and stood by his
side, like to the living man in stature and in face
and in voice, and in the very garments he had on;
and thus spake the spectre, in hollow and mournful
tones: "Ah! fickle heart, oblivious of the dead,
canst thou sleep, Achilles?  Has death broken the
bond which united us in life?  Bury me with all
speed, and let me wander no more, a homeless
ghost, at the gates of Hades, disowned and rejected
by the other spirits who have crossed the dark
river.  Give me thy hand, sweet friend, I entreat
thee!  For never again shall I return to earth,
when ye have given my body to the flames&mdash;never
more shall we sit retired from our comrades, as
once in life, and take sweet counsel together.  My
fate hath seized me, and cast me down into the pit
which was prepared for me when I was born; and
for thee too the bolt is prepared, which shall lay
thee low beneath the walls of Troy.  And one
more charge have I to lay upon thee: let not our
bones lie apart, Achilles, but let us be joined in
death, even as we were united in life.  One home,
one love, we shared, and thy father was to me as
mine own, from the day when I slew my playmate
in a childish brawl, and was brought by Men&oelig;tius to
the house of Peleus.  Therefore, when thy fate hath
reached thee, let our ashes be mingled in one urn."
</p>

<p>
"Wherefore, beloved," answered Achilles in his
sleep, "hast thou come hither to remind me of my
duty, and seemest to doubt my love?  Come
nearer, that I may embrace thee!  Yet a little
while let my heart beat against thine, and ease its
heavy burden of sorrow."
</p>

<p>
With these words he stretched out his eager
arms to clasp Patroclus to his breast; but the ghost
eluded his grasp, and with one piercing wail melted
away like smoke into the darkness.  "Alas!" cried
Achilles, springing up in amaze, and summoning
his comrades, "I perceive that, even in the house
of Hades, there is a spirit and a phantom of the
dead&mdash;but understanding none at all&mdash;for all night
long the ghost of the hapless Patroclus stood by
my side moaning and lamenting, and straitly
charging me concerning all that I must do.  And the
phantom was in aspect as the living man himself."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
At earliest dawn a long train of mules was seen
ascending the lower slopes of Ida, attended by a
numerous company of men, all carrying axes and
ropes of withes.  The whole troop was under the
command of Meriones, the squire of Idomeneus, on
whom the task had been laid of providing fuel for
the funeral pyre of Patroclus.  A large grove of
pines was felled, the trunks were divided into logs,
and these were bound into bundles and laid on the
backs of the mules.  Then down the slope they
were driven at a quick trot, the men running beside
them; and when they reached the camp the mules
were unloaded and the logs piled up in an open
space pointed out by Achilles.  A thousand willing
hands aided in the work, and soon a huge stack of
pinewood towered in the midst of the ships and tents.
</p>

<p>
When the pyre was raised, Achilles gave the
order to the Myrmidons to gird on their armour
and harness the steeds to their cars.  The whole
army stood waiting, drawn up in silence on either
side of the way by which the funeral train was to
pass; and presently the procession was seen
approaching.  First came the chariots, each carrying
two men&mdash;the driver, and the man-at-arms; behind
these followed a numerous troop of infantry,
marching slowly in dense array; and in the space between
the corpse was borne, covered with locks of hair
which the Myrmidons had cut off as a last tribute
to the dead.
</p>

<p>
Achilles walked behind the bier, supporting the
head of Patroclus in his hands, and moving heavily,
as one that mourns for a brother; and so they
passed on, through the long lane of mailed warriors,
until they came to the place where the pyre was built.
</p>

<p>
Then Achilles took a sharp knife, and cut off
from his forehead a long lock of hair, and, placing
the lock in the dead man's hand, turned round and
gazed wistfully across the dark gulf of waters which
divided him from his home.  "Alas for the hopes
of men!" he said, in a voice of distress.  "My
father Peleus designed this lock for another purpose,
as an offering to thee, Spercheus, my native stream,
if ever I returned safe from the war.  But now thine
altar, which stands in thy grove near thy sacred
source, shall never smoke for me again.  A foreign
grave awaits me, far from my home and kindred,
and Peleus is absolved from his vow.  Therefore
to thee, Patroclus, I dedicate this lock."
</p>

<p>
The Greeks now dispersed to their quarters
leaving those who were nearest to the dead, by
birth or by station, to perform the last rites.  The
chief mourners approached the bier, and lifting it
with the corpse placed it on the top of the pyre.
Many sheep and oxen were slaughtered and flayed,
and the body of Patroclus was wrapped from head
to foot in the fat taken from the carcasses.  Then
the carcasses of the victims were heaped up round
the bier, with jars of honey and olive-oil.  Four
horses were next slaughtered, and two favourite
hounds of Patroclus, and their bodies added to the
rest.  Last of all the twelve Trojan captives whom
he had taken in battle the day before were led in
chains to the spot, butchered by Achilles with his
own hands, and flung upon the pyre.
</p>

<p>
"It is done!" cried Achilles, when this last
savage tribute was paid to his friend, "I have
accomplished my vow, and the fire may now do its
work&mdash;but for thee, Hector, no fire shall be lighted,
but dogs shall devour thee."
</p>

<p>
That cruel threat at least was not to be fulfilled.
Unseen hands were busy about the fallen Trojan
hero, guarding him day and night from the prowling
dogs of the camp.  Aphrodite embalmed his body
with a heavenly essence, which closed all his wounds,
and kept his flesh pure and unharmed; and Apollo
covered all the place where he lay with a dark cloud,
to shield him from the scorching rays of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile torches had been brought to kindle
the pyre.  But the huge mass smouldered sullenly,
and the victims remained unconsumed.  Then
Achilles took a golden bowl, and pouring a libation
to Boreas and Zephyrus, the twin gods of the winds,
prayed them to lend their blasts and blow the fire to
a blaze.  Iris heard his prayer, and went swiftly to
call the winds to his aid.  She found them seated
at table with all their brethren in the house of
Zephyrus; and thus spake Iris to that boisterous
company: "Why sit ye here feasting and making
merry, when there is work for you to do?  Hear
ye not the prayers of Achilles, who needs your help,
that the pyre of Patroclus may burn freely, and
consume him to ashes, with all that lies about him."
</p>

<p>
Prompt at the summons, the winds arose, with
clamour and uproarious din, and rushed down the
mountainside, chasing the clouds before them.
Over the complaining sea they swept, and flew
whistling onward till they reached the shores of
Troy.  There they fell upon the smouldering pyre,
and the flames leaped and bellowed in response to
the roaring blast.  So all night long they lashed
the fire to fury, and all night long Achilles paced
to and fro before the pyre, pouring libations from
a golden bowl on the ground, and calling aloud to
the ghost of his ill-starred friend.  As mourns a
father when he burns the bones of his son, a young
bridegroom cut off by death on his wedding-day, so
mourned Achilles as the fire devoured his comrade's
body&mdash;so pitiful were his cries, so faltering his gait.
</p>

<p>
Towards dawn the fire began to die out, and
nothing was left but a vast heap of glowing ashes.
Then the winds went back to their home, and
earth and ocean sank to rest, beneath the gentle
light of the morning star.  Soothed by the calm
influence of the hour, Achilles fell into a fitful
slumber, but was soon aroused by the sound of
footsteps and the murmur of voices.  Starting up,
he saw a goodly company of nobles approaching,
with Agamemnon at their head; and with their
assistance the ritual ceremonies due to the dead
were completed.  First, they poured wine on the
glowing mass of embers, till the last spark was
extinguished; then they collected the ashes of
Patroclus, which lay by themselves, surrounded by
the charred remains of beasts and men.  A costly
urn of gold received the few handfuls of dust which
were all that remained of him whom they had so
cherished and honoured; and the urn was buried
in a low mound of earth, which was one day to be
raised to a commanding height, as a monument to
the great Achilles.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
When the last tribute of sorrow had been paid,
the rest of the day was devoted to sport and
festivity.  In heroic times funeral games were an
important part of the honours assigned to a fallen
warrior; and those of Patroclus were celebrated
on a scale of unrivalled magnificence.
</p>

<p>
The great event of the day was to be the chariot
race, and splendid prizes were offered by Achilles,
who was the sole patron and prize giver, for the
winners.  When the gifts were set in order,
Achilles rose and invited all who prided themselves
in their horsemanship to take part in the friendly
contest.  "If," he said, "we were keeping this
festival in honour of any other Greek, I myself
must needs carry off the first prize; for no steeds
in all the army can vie with mine, the immortal
coursers which were a gift from Poseidon to my
father.  But this is a day of mourning both to
me and to them; for they have lost their gentle
charioteer, and now stand, sorrow-stricken, with
manes drooping to the ground, in their stalls,
deprived of his loving care.  Therefore take your
places, all ye who would prove the mettle of your
horses, and your own mastery of this gallant game."
</p>

<p>
Four chieftains brought their cars to try their
fortune in the race: Eumelus, a prince of Thessaly,
a land renowned for its breed of horses; Diomede,
who drove the horses which he had taken from
Ã†neas; Menelaus, with a mare of Agamemnon's,
named Arthe, and his own horse Podargus; and
Antilochus, whose car was drawn by a pair from
his father's stables.  Nestor, who knew their
quality, which was indeed but poor, accompanied
his son to the starting-point, and as they were
the first to arrive he improved the occasion by
proffering a world of good advice, reinforced by
many a pithy saw, showing Antilochus how the
want of speed may be remedied by cunning and
skill.  "Art," he said, "is far greater than force.
Art drives the axe, though aimed by a weaker arm,
deep into the heart of the oak; art controls the
motions of tall ships, by means of a very small
helm; and art may save thee from reaching the
goal last in this race."
</p>

<p>
In the ancient chariot races the starting-point
and the winning-post were always the same, as it
was the custom to run a certain distance, and then
wheel round a certain point, and return on the
homeward track, which was parallel to the other.
The turning-point was marked by a pillar, or some
other conspicuous object, and here a desperate
struggle often took place between the rival cars for
the inside place, taxing the skill and courage of the
drivers to the utmost.  Nestor had been over the
course, and gave his son minute directions as to
the appearance and position of the turning-post,
which was far off on the plain, and invisible from
the starting-point.  "You will see," he said, "a
withered stump of oak or fir, rising to about a
fathom above the earth, with a white stone leaning
against it on either side.  There you must turn;
and see that you lose no ground in wheeling round
to the homeward track.  Give your right horse
the reins, and urge him to full speed with voice and
lash, but rein in the other, and hold him back; and
let the nave of your left wheel just seem to graze
the stump.  If you can pass another car in turning,
there is no fear that he will catch you again.
Thou hast my counsel: go, and prosper&mdash;be wary,
and be wise."
</p>

<p>
At the last moment a fifth chariot appeared on
the scene, driven by Meriones.  Lots were cast for
the stations, and Antilochus was so fortunate as to
obtain the inside place.  The cars drew up in a
line, Achilles gave the word, and away they went
in a cloud of dust, the horses' manes streaming, the
drivers shouting, and the cars gliding smoothly, or
leaping and plunging at the uneven places.
</p>

<p>
Soon the cars began to separate by wider and
wider intervals, and a keen struggle ensued between
the Thracian horses, driven by Eumelus, and the
Trojans, driven by Diomede.  Eumelus took the
lead, but Diomede followed him so close that he
felt the hot breath of the pursuing horses on his back.
So they ran for about a bowshot; then Diomede
dropped his whip, and his horses, wanting the lash,
began to fall back.  This accident befell him by the
malice of Apollo, who owed him a grudge for the
havoc which he had wrought among the Trojans.
But Athene had not forgotten her favourite, and
she contrived that he should recover his whip,
and put fresh mettle into his steeds.  Nor did she
stop there, but, overtaking the car of Eumelus, she
broke the yoke which coupled his horses, so that
they reared violently in opposite directions, and the
pole of the car was dashed to the ground.  Thus
suddenly arrested at the height of his speed,
Eumelus rolled headlong from the car, and sustained
woeful damage.  The skin was torn from his elbows
and nose and mouth, his forehead was severely
bruised, and he lay for a while senseless where he
fell.  This mishap secured an easy victory for
Diomede.  Avoiding the wreck, he pressed onwards,
leaving the whole field far behind, turned the goal
successfully, and drove at an easy gallop along the
homeward track.
</p>

<p>
He was followed at a long distance by Menelaus,
now second in the race; and the third place was
held by Antilochus, whose ambition had been fired
by the unlooked-for good fortune of Diomede, so
that he hoped by some similar accident to obtain at
least the second prize.  Cheering on his horses, he
went hard in pursuit of Menelaus, who was just
then approaching a difficult piece of ground, where
the course had been hollowed out by the winter rains.
The place was too narrow to allow two cars to pass,
and Antilochus determined to secure the lead before
Menelaus had time to reach the broad course on
the other side of the ravine.  Accordingly he plied
the lash unsparingly, and overtook Menelaus at the
moment when he was about to enter the neck of the
dry watercourse.  "Keep back!" shouted Menelaus
in alarm.  "Do not try to pass me here, or you
will wreck both our cars."
</p>

<p>
Antilochus pretended not to hear, and drove on
harder than ever, so that Menelaus, who was a
timid driver, was compelled to rein in his horses
and let him go by.
</p>

<p>
While the race was being thus run, with varying
turns of fortune, the chieftains assembled round
Achilles were sitting in their places, waiting for the
return of the cars, and discussing the chances of the
drivers.  Presently Idomeneus, who sat somewhat
apart from the rest, in a position which gave him
a long view over the course, cried out excitedly:
"Diomede is leading!  I can see the white mark on
the face of one of the horses, which shows that he
is one of the Trojan stallions&mdash;the red chestnut,
with a mark like a half-moon on his forehead.
Look out, some of you who have younger eyes
than mine, and see if I am right."
</p>

<p>
"Hold thy peace, old prater!" said Ajax, son of
Oileus, roughly.  "We can see nothing yet&mdash;neither
canst thou.  Eumelus was leading when we saw
him last, and doubtless he is leading still."
</p>

<p>
"Thou mannerless fellow!" answered Idomeneus
hotly.  "Foremost in a brawl, and in all else the
least of the Greeks!  Come, let us lay a wager, and
Agamemnon shall hold the stakes; or art thou
afraid to back thy saucy tongue?"
</p>

<p>
Ajax started up in a rage, hurling abuse at the
Cretan veteran, and words would have soon led to
blows, had not Achilles interposed his authority to
put an end to the quarrel.  "For shame!" he said,
rising from his seat, "I wonder to hear you, two men
of name and high station, wrangling like boors.  What
avails this idle contention?  Wait but a moment, and
the winner will be here to answer for himself."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke, a loud huzza was heard, and
a moment after, the Trojan car, driven by Diomede,
turned the last corner, and came racing lightly down
the last straight stretch of the course, until it was
pulled up before the chair of Achilles.  Sthenelus
was standing ready to welcome his comrade, and
the first prize&mdash;a female slave, and a huge cauldron
for heating water for the bath&mdash;was forthwith
delivered to the victor.
</p>

<p>
After a long interval Antilochus came in, driving
at a heavy gallop, and hotly pursued by Menelaus,
who was gaining at every stride, and had by this
time reduced the wide gap which had separated
them to a mere hand's-breadth.  His horses were
displaying splendid mettle, especially the mare
Arthe, who had been given to Agamemnon by a
wealthy noble of Sicyon, as the price of his exemption
from serving in the war; and if the course had
been a bowshot longer he would have passed
Antilochus, and taken the second prize.  As it was,
he came in third, but those who stood near as he was
dismounting could see that he was red with indignation,
and big with some grievance, real or supposed.
</p>

<p>
The fourth was Meriones, who was a poor driver,
and whose steeds were the weakest; and last of all
came Eumelus, with face sorely disfigured, dragging
his wrecked car behind him, and driving before
him his horses.  "The last man is the best!" cried
Achilles, moved to pity by his ill-fortune.  "How
say you, sirs?  Shall we not give him the second
prize?"  The proposal found general approval,
excepting, of course, with Antilochus, who loudly
protested against such an award.  "Thou art no
friend of mine, Achilles," he said angrily, "if thou
deprive me of the gift which I have fairly earned.
Prizes are given to reward the winners, not to
console the unlucky.  If you wish to be generous,
you can make Eumelus happy by bestowing on
him some other gift, of equal or greater value,
out of the rich store which is laid up in your tent.
But this prize is mine, and I will not give her up
no, not if I have to fight for her."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he seized the halter of the mare, who
was tethered near, with her foal, to be given to him
who won the second place.
</p>

<p>
The great Achilles smiled indulgently at the
defiant attitude of Antilochus, who was very dear
to him.  "It shall be as you say," he replied.
"The prize is yours, and to Eumelus I will give
the corslet of AsteropÃ¦us, which I won in the
battle yesterday."  Automedon brought the corslet&mdash;a
curious piece of work, finely fashioned in brass,
with a casting of white metal&mdash;and Eumelus' eyes
glistened with pleasure as he received it.
</p>

<p>
But the storm which had been lowering in the
face of Menelaus ever since Antilochus had passed
him now burst.  Having caused the herald to
proclaim silence he took the staff from his hands, as a
sign that he had an important statement to make,
and standing up before the whole assembly
proclaimed his wrongs to the ears of all.  "I am
astonished," he said, "at the conduct of Antilochus.
He has beaten me in the race by a trick, though
his horses are far inferior to mine in any fair trial of
speed.  I appeal to all those present to say whether
it is not so.  If he denies it, let him take his whip in
his hand, and holding his horses by the rein swear
a solemn oath, in the name of Poseidon, the god of
horsemanship, that he did not hinder me by fraud
in the race."
</p>

<p>
Menelaus was clearly in the wrong, indeed, his
whole plea was absurd; for nothing but his own
faint-heartedness had lost him the second prize.
But out of respect to his high rank and amiable
character Antilochus was willing to appease him.
Accordingly he brought the mare with her foal to
Menelaus, and placing the bridle in his hand said
respectfully: "Spare me thy reproaches, gentle
prince!  I yield to thee the prize, and would sacrifice
much more than this, rather than lose thy favour
and incur the anger of heaven."
</p>

<p>
As falls the refreshing dew on the bristling ears
of barley, when the crops are ripening, so fell the
soft answer of Antilochus on the Spartan prince's
heart, and the sharp stings of resentment pricked
him no more.  "Thou shalt have the prize," he
said mildly, "though it is mine by right.  Thou art
not wont to be so heedless of what is due to others:
but this time thy young blood didst get the mastery
of thy better sense.  Take heed that thou art not
so reckless again.  I have yielded to thee in this
for thy father's sake, and for thine also; for ye have
both suffered many things in my cause."  And so
the dispute, which threatened to disturb the harmony
of the meeting, was happily ended.
</p>

<p>
Five prizes had been offered for the race, and as
Eumelus had received a special gift, the fifth prize,
a drinking goblet, still remained unclaimed.
Observing this, Achilles seized the occasion of showing
his esteem for the venerable King of Pylos.  So he
took the cup, and going to the place where Nestor
was sitting put it in his hands.  "Take this,
father," he said, "as a memorial of our lost Patroclus,
in whose honour we are met to-day.  Thou art full
of years and honours, and deservest the highest prize
of all, though thou canst not strive with young men
in boxing, or in wrestling, or in speed of foot."
</p>

<p>
"Thou sayest truly, my son," answered the old
man, "my feet are heavy with age, and my arms
dart not nimbly from the shoulder, as they did
of yore.  Yet the day has been when none could
vie with me in feats of strength and skill.  Well do
I remember the funeral games of a noble prince of
Elis, where I won the prize in every contest, except
only in the chariot race, and then I was
overmatched by numbers, for the winning car had two
drivers, one plying the lash, and the other
managing the reins.  Alas for my youth!  Alas for my
vanished strength!  Now I must be content to see
others excel, though once I was mighty among
the mightiest.  Let then the games proceed, and
receive an old man's blessing for thy kindly gift."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
"Now let the boxers try their skill and hardihood,"
said Achilles, when he had returned to his
seat.  "Here is a stout mule of six years old for
the winner, and for the loser there is a silver cup."
</p>

<p>
In answer to the challenge a huge champion
named Epeus strode into the ring, and, laying his
hand on the mule, cried boastfully: "Come on,
whoever wishes to win the cup!  The mule is
surely mine, for there is no boxer here who
can match me.  If there be anyone who would
dispute the prize with me, let him stand up, when
he has made all ready for his funeral&mdash;for I will
pound his flesh, and batter his bones, until he is
fit only for burial."
</p>

<p>
Epeus, with his massive frame and brawny arms,
seemed quite capable of performing his threats, and
it was some time before anyone was found willing
to face him.  At last Euryalus, an Argive, whose
father had been a famous boxer, was encouraged
by his friend Diomede to try his chances in this
painful and dangerous sport; and having stripped
to the waist, and bound their hands with tough
leathern thongs, the two combatants confronted
each other in the centre of the ring.  The struggle
was very short, for after they had fenced a little
with their fists Euryalus received a crushing blow
on the side of his jaw, and dropped in a heap where
he stood, like a great fish flung by the waves on
the beach.  Spitting out blood, and rolling his head
from side to side, he was led away by his friends,
and Epeus carried off the mule in triumph.
</p>

<p>
Then followed a hard-contested match between
Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax, for the championship
in wrestling.  Stripped, like the boxers, to the
waist, they clutched each other in a fierce embrace,
and remained thus locked together, their strong
arms crossed like the rafters in a roof, and their
sides growing black under the iron pressure.  They
seemed rooted to the ground, and neither could
stir the other an inch.  Then Ajax, suddenly
exerting his enormous strength, lifted Odysseus bodily
into the air; but Odysseus struck him with his heel
behind the knee, and they fell together, Odysseus
above, and Ajax below.  Rising again to their feet
they wrestled a second bout, and this time
Odysseus, though foiled in his attempt to lift the
huge bulk of his antagonist, succeeded in tripping
him by a crook of the knee, and they came down
again, and lay side by side.  Once more they would
have renewed the struggle, but Achilles put an end
to the contest, and awarded them an equal prize.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful silver bowl, the work of Sidonian
artists, which Achilles had once received as the
ransom of the unhappy Lycaon, was now offered
as the first prize for the foot race.  The second
prize was a fat ox, and the third one half of a talent
of gold.  There were three competitors: the lesser
Ajax, who was famed for his speed of foot,
Odysseus, and Antilochus.  The distance was about
a furlong, and Ajax took the lead from the start,
though Odysseus pressed him so hard that he
seemed glued to him; and so they ran, without
changing their positions, over half the course, the
Greeks shouting to encourage Odysseus, who was
a popular favourite.  Still Ajax held the lead, and
seemed about to win, when he slipped in a miry
place, where the ground was wet with the blood of
the oxen slaughtered by Achilles at the funeral of
Patroclus, and pitched head foremost in the horrid
mire, which filled his mouth and nostrils.  But he
was on his feet again in a moment, and though
he could not overtake Odysseus he succeeded in
obtaining the second prize.  "It is an old story,"
he said, holding the ox by the horn, and spitting
out the slime which filled his mouth; "Odysseus
was helped by Athene, who watches over him as a
mother over her child."
</p>

<p>
The Greeks laughed at his discomfiture, and
found fresh matter for mirth in the humorous
excuses of Antilochus, who had been left far behind
in the race.  "You know," he said, "that the gods
are always on the side of the elder men; Ajax is a
little older than I, and Odysseus belongs to another
generation.  But he is in a green old age, and none
can vie with him in speed, except only Achilles."
</p>

<p>
"Thy praise shall not be spoken for nothing,"
said Achilles, smiling, and he gave him one half of a
talent of gold as a reward for his good words.
</p>

<p>
Contests in archery and throwing the weight
succeeded, and an encounter with sword and spear
took place between Ajax and Diomede.  Then
Achilles offered two prizes for throwing the javelin,
and Agamemnon, in recognition of his high rank
and known skill in this exercise, was allowed to
take the first prize without a trial.  With this
incident the games came to an end.

<h3>
Priam ransoms the Body of Hector
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The busy day was over, and night sank
down on the Grecian camp, bringing to all,
save one tormented spirit, the blessed gift of
sleep.  With silence and solitude the pangs of
sorrow awakened with new keenness in the heart
of Achilles, and he lay tossing and turning on his
uneasy pillow, seeking rest, and finding none.  A
thousand memories of his friendship with
Patroclus&mdash;gallant adventures, hairbreadth escapes, moving
accidents by flood and field&mdash;coursed through his
mind, bringing home to him the immensity of his
loss.  After some hours of sleepless misery he
sprang to his feet, and throwing on his clothes
went down to the sea, and roamed distracted along
the sand.  With the first glimmer of daylight he
yoked his horses to the car, and drove round and
round the tomb of Patroclus, dragging after him
the body of Hector.  Having made the circuit
of the tomb three times, he unyoked his horses,
and retired once more to his tent, leaving his lifeless
victim face downwards in the dust.
</p>

<p>
Twelve days passed; and every day the same
outrage was repeated.  All the gods, except
Poseidon, Hera, and Athene, whose hatred of all
things Trojan was inveterate, were indignant at
his senseless barbarity, and they began to urge
Hermes to steal Hector's body, and restore it to
his friends.  But nothing was done until, on the
twelfth day, Apollo rose up and reproached the
gods, who were met in full assembly, for their cruel
indifference.  "Is there no pity," he said, "is
there no justice, left in heaven, that ye suffer this
inhuman son of Peleus to wreak his brutal fury on
the body of a man of stainless life, constant all his
days in sacrifice and prayer?  All your favour is
lavished on Achilles, who has the heart of a
ravening lion, nourished in havoc and carnage.  Death
lies about the paths of mortals, taking their nearest
and their dearest; yet sorrow must sleep at last,
for patience is the best gift which the gods have
given to men.  But this man is more cruel in his
love than in his hate, and because he has lost a friend
his rancour burns on like an unquenchable fire."
</p>

<p>
"Thou forgettest," answered Hera, "that Achilles
is the son of a goddess, and shares the privileges of
divine descent.  His father also was a favourite of
heaven, and thou thyself, Ph&oelig;bus, didst lend the
music of thy harp to grace his nuptials; but now,
it seemeth, thou takest delight in baser company."
</p>

<p>
"Fair consort," said Zeus, "be not thus implacable.
Granted that Achilles stands higher in honour,
yet Hector hath also his claim on our regard, for
none was ever more pious than he.  Therefore, that
we may end this miserable coil at once, let Iris go
and summon hither his mother Thetis, that we may
contrive some way of restoring Hector to his people."
</p>

<p>
Iris hastened to obey the command, and, stooping
from Olympus to the surface of the sea, dropped
like a leaden plummet into the purple depths, until
she reached the grotto where Thetis dwelt.  She
found her sitting among the Nereids, mourning the
lot of her matchless son, whose death was near
at hand.  "What wants the monarch of heaven
from me?" she asked, when she heard the summons
from Zeus.  "I am ill prepared to attend the
happy session of the gods, for grief has clouded
my mind and marred my face."  Nevertheless she
rose to go, and putting on a veil of funereal
blackness followed Iris, who brought her speedily to the
assembly of the gods.
</p>

<p>
"We thank thee, Thetis," said Zeus, beckoning
her to a seat next to his throne, "that thou hast
answered so promptly to our call.  We know thy
sorrows, and have respect for thee and thy son;
and for this cause have we sent for thee.  For
nine days there has been strife among us, concerning
the body of Hector, which Achilles still keeps
in his possession.  Some there were who would
have had Hermes steal it away, but this I would
not suffer, out of regard to thy son's honour.  But
go thou to the camp, and tell him that we are sore
displeased with him, because in his madness he
keeps the corpse of his enemy and will not ransom
it.  And I will send Iris with a charge to Priam,
that he may go with acceptable gifts to the tent
of Achilles, and redeem the body for burial."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Still nursing his wound, still torn by the demons
of rage and grief, Achilles sat moodily in his tent,
while his comrades were busy about him, preparing
the morning meal.  Suddenly he felt a gentle
touch on his shoulder, and looking up he saw his
mother's face bent over him, with looks of sympathy
and love.  "My son," she said, in a low sweet
voice, "how long wilt thou devour thy heart in
bootless anguish, refusing meat and drink, and
spurning the tender offices of human affection?
O darken not the little remnant that remains to
thee of life, but take what good thou canst, and
at least live as a man.  I have come with a message
to thee from Zeus, who bids thee to give up
Hector's body, and receive the ransom which his
friends will offer thee."
</p>

<p>
"Be it so," answered Achilles.  "Let them
bring the price, and I will give back the
body."  Overjoyed by his ready consent, Thetis bade him
farewell, and returned to her ocean home.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the ever-active Iris was gone on
another errand, carrying the commands of Zeus
to Priam.  Swiftly she passed through the streets
of Troy, and entered the house of woe, where the
voice of sorrow had never ceased since the day
when Hector had fallen by the hands of Achilles.
Priam himself was lying prostrate on the ground
in the courtyard, with his white locks defied with
dust and ashes.  Round him were gathered his
sons, trying in vain to rouse him from his stupor;
and at the windows were seen from time to time
the white faces of women, when any of his daughters
paused in their household tasks to glance at the
sorrow-stricken group outside.
</p>

<p>
Lying thus, mute and motionless, Priam was
startled to hear a still, small voice, which seemed
to be speaking at a great distance, addressing him
in these words: "Take comfort, son of Dardanus,
and be not dismayed!  I who speak have not come
to foretell thee harm, but only good.  Thy cries and
thy groanings have gone up to the ear of Zeus, and
he hath sent me to comfort and advise thee.
Hearken now, and do as I shall tell thee: let them
prepare thee a wain, loaded with precious gifts, and
go thou in thy car to the tent of Achilles, and let
only a herald go with thee, a man stricken in years
like thyself, to guide the mules.  Fear nothing, for
heaven is near thee, and the gods have put it into
the heart of Achilles to hear thy prayer."
</p>

<p>
To the amazement of those who stood near, and
who knew nothing of the cause, new life and energy
were seen to enter the palsied limbs of Priam, and
starting to his feet he ordered his sons to prepare
the mule car, and make fast to it the great wicker
basket which was used for the carriage of goods.
Then, without staying for question or reply, he
hastened into the house, and calling to Hecuba
made known to her his purpose.  When she heard
what he intended, Hecuba lifted up her hands, and
answered in tones of astonishment and terror.  "Is
it Priam who speaks&mdash;the monarch revered for his
wisdom even in distant lands&mdash;or is it some
madman who has taken upon him Priam's likeness?
What, wilt thou go into the presence of that butcher,
whose savage hands have made thee all but childless?
Faithless and ruthless as he is, thinkest thou
that he will reverence thy grey hairs?  No, he will
slaughter thee without pity, and give us new cause
for tears.  Hector hath received the portion
appointed to him at his birth, and dogs shall eat his
flesh where he lies in the tent of that man of blood.
May the curse of heaven light on his slayer!  Would
that I could tear his heart with my teeth, and devour
it!  Then would my noble son be avenged, who
died bravely before the face of all his people, with
no thought of flight or escape."
</p>

<p>
But Priam was not to be shaken in his resolve.
"Seek not to hinder me," he answered, "and vex
me not with thy evil forebodings.  I go not at
the bidding of any earthly prophet, but with direct
assurance of the aid and countenance of heaven.
If I have been deceived, I am prepared to die, so
that the stroke but find me holding my son in my
arms, and clinging to him in a last embrace."
</p>

<p>
With that he went to his treasure-chamber, and
opening the chests of cedarwood took from them
rich robes, choice tapestries, and costly raiment.
To these he added ten talents of gold and a bowl
of silver, which he had received as a gift of honour
when he went on an embassy to Thrace.  And
having set the gifts in order he went forth again
into the courtyard, to hasten the preparations for
his journey.  Finding there a crowd of Trojans,
whom some rumour had drawn to the palace, he
drove them all out, beating them with his staff, and
crying: "What make ye here, idle caitiffs?  Have
ye not sorrow enough at home that ye come hither
to chatter and pry into my grief?  Ye will soon
learn what ye have lost in my Hector, when ye fly
like sheep without a shepherd before the wolves of
Greece."  The Trojans fled before the old man's
anger, and he looked about him, seeking his sons.
"Where are ye," he cried, "children of my shame?
Would that ye had all perished, and Hector alone
were left!  Alas! the best are ever taken first, and
in those that remain there is neither comfort nor
strength, but only dishonour and reproach.  Liars,
dancers, devourers of the people&mdash;these are my
children now."
</p>

<p>
Roused by the loud rebukes of their father, the
young princes made haste to bring forth the mule
car and harness the mules.  Then they loaded
the car with the gifts to Achilles, and yoked to
the chariot the horses which Priam himself was to
drive.
</p>

<p>
When all was ready, Hecuba came and stood by
the chariot, bearing a golden cup filled with wine.
"Take this," she said to Priam, "and pour a drink-offering
to Zeus, if so be that he will vouchsafe thee
a sign, and show thee whether it be by his will or
not that thou goest on this journey."
</p>

<p>
"Thou sayest well," answered Priam.  "It is a
good thing to hold up our hands to heaven in
prayer."  Thereupon he washed his hands in water,
which was brought by a handmaid, took the cup
from his wife, and standing by the altar in the
middle of the courtyard lifted up his voice and
prayed: "Lord of Ida, most glorious, most great,
grant that the heart of Achilles may incline in pity
towards me, and send thy messenger, the swift eagle
whom thou lovest best of all fowls, that having
seen him we may go with good heart and courage
to the Grecian camp."
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke, a mighty eagle was seen soaring
over the city on the right hand, with his vast wings
outspread, like the folding doors of a rich man's
house.  Rejoicing in the omen, Priam mounted his
chariot, and drove through the echoing porch,
preceded by the herald IdÃ¦us, who drove the mule
car.  Along the streets they passed, making what
speed they could, through the multitudes who had
flocked out to see them depart, and who mourned
them as already dead.
</p>

<p>
Night had fallen, and all the sky was thick set
with stars, as they left the city gates, and turned
their faces towards the sea.  When they reached
the ford of the river they paused to let the animals
drink: and while they halted IdÃ¦us suddenly cried
out in tones of terror: "My lord, we are undone!
I see a man approaching, and I fear he means us
no good."  Priam peered out into the darkness,
following with his eyes the pointing finger of IdÃ¦us,
and saw a tall figure moving with rapid steps
towards them.
</p>

<p>
"What doest thou here?" said the stranger, who
was a graceful and comely youth, and whose voice
sounded like the chiming of a silver bell.  "Why
art thou here unguarded, at the very gates of the
foe?  But be of good cheer&mdash;I will not harm thee,
nor suffer others to do so.  I see in thee a likeness
to my dear father."
</p>

<p>
"Fair youth," answered Priam, whose alarm had
vanished before the gentle mien and kind words of
the young Greek, "surely some god has sent thee
in my way, in pity for my helpless state.  Tell me,
who art thou, and who is the father who is blest with
such a son?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a follower of Achilles," was the startling
reply, "and came hither in the same ship.  My
father is Polyctor, a wealthy man, and of like age
with thee.  I am the youngest of seven sons, and
the lot fell upon me to follow the host to Troy.
And this night I came out to spy upon the
movements of the Trojans."
</p>

<p>
"If thou art a comrade of Achilles," said Priam,
"thou canst tell me concerning my son Hector.
Lies his body still by the ships, or has Achilles
given it already to his dogs to devour?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither dog," answered the other, "nor unclean
fowl hath approached him, nor hath the worm had
power over his flesh.  Unmarred by violence,
untouched by decay, he lieth, without soil or stain,
and all his wounds are closed.  This miracle the
gods have wrought, in the great love which they
bear him."
</p>

<p>
"Glad news thou tellest me," said Priam, "and
now I know that piety hath its reward, even in
death."  Then he took out a silver cup from the
mule car, and offering it to the stranger said:
"Take this for thyself, and conduct me safe to the
ships of Achilles, that I may see the face of my son."
</p>

<p>
"Tempt me not, old man," replied the Greek.
"This cup belongs to Achilles, and if I should steal
it from him what thinkest thou that he would do
unto me?  But come, give me the reins, and I will
guide thee to thy goal&mdash;yea, though it were in
distant Argos, thou shouldst reach it safe and sound,
and none should molest thee."
</p>

<p>
So saying, he sprang to the side of Priam, and
took the reins.  Under his guidance the horses
seemed to be endued with wings, and in a very
short time they reached the main entrance of the
camp.  The gates flew open, as if by magic, and all
the sentries were sleeping at their posts.  On to the
extreme verge of the camp they went, still
unchallenged, and drew up at length before a high
stockade, within which were the quarters of Achilles.
Once more the gates opened at a touch, and they
entered.  Here the mysterious stranger dismounted
from the car, and turning on Priam a countenance
which shone with a celestial radiance he said: "I
have brought thee to the place where thou wouldst
go, and now I will leave thee, for the task is finished
which Zeus my father gave me to do.  For know
that I am Hermes, the herald of the gods, and the
strong helper of those that are in need."

The dwelling of Achilles, which, for want of a
better word, we have called a tent, was in reality
a roomy building, constructed of solid pine trunks,
and thatched with moss and rushes.  On this
memorable evening Achilles was sitting in the
main apartment of the dwelling, and two of his
squires were removing the vessels used at the
evening meal.  The light of the fire gleamed
fitfully on his face, and he seemed in a gentler and
more placid mood than had been usual with him
for many days.  He had partaken freely of food
and wine, and conversed cheerfully with his
attendants.  He was now silent, and sat musing quietly
by himself, when suddenly, to his amazement, an
old man of tall stature and regal port entered the
room, and throwing himself on the ground before
him clasped his knees and kissed his hands&mdash;those
terrible murderous hands!&mdash;bathing them with his
tears.  Like a man who has slain a fellow-countryman,
and enters the house of some wealthy noble,
where a great company is gathered, to implore
shelter and protection&mdash;for the avenger of blood is
at his heels&mdash;so seemed that aged man to Achilles
and those that were with him, so trembling,
helpless, and forlorn.  And as they gazed in deep
wonder, murmuring to each other the name of
Priam, he began, in a voice broken with weeping,
to urge his petition: "Pity me, Achilles, for thy
father's sake, an old man like me, standing on the
brink of the grave.  Maybe he is in sole straits,
oppressed by those that dwell about him, for want
of thy succouring arm.  Yet still he has hope, as
long as thou livest, and looks forward to the joyful
day of thy return.  But what hope have I, what
solace, what refuge from the blows which fate aims
without ceasing at mine afflicted head?  Fifty sons
I had, when the sons of Greece first came to these
shores, and of these the greater part have paid
their last tribute to the stern god of war.  And he,
the bravest and the best, the bulwark of my city,
fell by thy hand not many days since.  Him have
I come to ransom at a great price.  In the name
of thy father, in the name of the gods whom we
both adore, have mercy on me, Achilles&mdash;on me,
who have found it in my heart to do what mortal
never did before, to lift to my lips the hand that
slew my son!"
</p>

<p>
Then at last that iron-hearted man was melted
into compassion when he saw the renowned King of
Asia prostrate at his feet, humbled to the dust for
the sake of one poor boon&mdash;permission to give his
son's body to the grave.  And the sight of all that
misery awakened anew the thought of his own sad
lot, his recent loss, his brief and troubled life, soon
to be ended by a coward's hand, the desolation of
his home, and his father pining in solitary old age.
Surely he also had cause enough for tears!
</p>

<p>
So the two great enemies were united for the
time by the common bond of human sorrow.  Then
Achilles rose, and, taking the old man by the hand,
led him to a seat, and placing himself by his side
said to him: "O marked by sorrow's seal before
all the children of men, what a heart must thou
have, to meet me face to face, who have given
to death so many of thy valiant sons!  But thou
knowest that it is the common lot: only the gods
know neither care nor grief, but mortal life is
encompassed with ills.  Two caskets there are
which stand by the throne of Zeus, one filled with
good gifts, and the other with evil gifts.  And for
the more part Zeus mingles the gifts, and tempers
much evil with a little good; but now and then
some wretch receives naught but evil, and wanders
from land to land as misery's thrall, branded by the
malice of fate.  To Peleus, my father, good things
were given at first&mdash;wealth, power, and prosperity,
and a goddess for his bride.  But now he is
receiving his portion of ill.  And thou too, Priam, wast
in old times renowned for the number of thy blessings,
and men called thee great king, happy father,
and envied thine abundance.  But in thy latter
years thou hast seen naught but wars and fightings,
losses and deaths.  So shifts the tide, so turns the
scale, now up, now down, and naught that we can
do will avail to raise or diminish by one tittle the
sum of our fate."
</p>

<p>
Up to this point Priam had prospered in his
mission beyond his hopes.  But now he obtained a
glimpse of the fearful passions which were smouldering
in the breast of Achilles, and ready at any
moment to leap up in devouring flames.  Being
invited by Achilles to stay and rest awhile before
resuming his journey, he would have refused,
alleging that he could not rest until he had the body
of Hector safe in his keeping.  But that fierce and
imperious nature brooked not the slightest hint of
opposition.  "Provoke me no further, old man,"
said the terrible chieftain, with a dark glance at his
guest.  "Hector's body thou shalt have&mdash;but there
must be no unseemly haste.  My heart is exceeding
sore; touch not thou the galled spot, lest I should
do thee mischief, and break the ordinances of heaven."
</p>

<p>
Then, leaving Priam where he sat, Achilles went
out with Automedon and another of his squires,
and, bidding IdÃ¦us attend his master, they unyoked
the mules, and brought in the ransom.  "Now,
haste thee, Automedon," said Achilles, in a low
tone, "go with the handmaids to the place where
Hector's body lies, and when they have washed
and anointed it return with it hither.  Be silent,
and be wary; for if Priam sees what ye are
doing&mdash;if he catches sight of Hector's body, where
now it lies&mdash;I fear that he will break out into
anger against me, and becoming outrageous
provoke me to slay him."
</p>

<p>
Having carried out their orders with all due
caution, they brought the body, wrapped in fine
linen, and Achilles with his own hands placed it
in the mule car.  But he groaned in spirit when
he thought of his promise to Patroclus, and cried
aloud, invoking his ghost: "Take it not amiss,
my Patroclus, when the news reaches thee in the
house of the dead, that I have restored the body
of thy slayer.  His father hath paid me no mean
ransom, whereof thou shalt have thy share."
</p>

<p>
The laws of hospitality required that Priam
should not leave Achilles' roof without breaking
bread.  Accordingly, on his return to the house,
Achilles urged his guest to take some food.
"Remember," he said, "that Niobe herself, so
constant in her sorrow that even now, though
turned to a stone, she weeps and weeps for ever&mdash;even
she tasted food when the first anguish of her
grief was passed.  Thou knowest her sad story&mdash;how
she boasted that she had borne twelve fair
children, six stalwart sons and six lovely
daughters&mdash;and taunted Leto that she had only borne two.
But those two were Apollo and Artemis, a god and
a goddess, and they slew all the children of Niobe,
to avenge the insult to their mother.  Apollo slew
the sons with his silver bow, and Artemis, the
archer-goddess, slew the daughters.  For nine
days they lay in their blood, with none to give
them burial; but on the tenth day the gods buried
them with their own hands.  And if she, that
stricken mother, could sit down to meat, so do
thou also, Priam; after that, thou shall take some
sleep, and at dawn I will send thee back in safety
to Troy."
</p>

<p>
The meal was prepared, and they sat down face
to face at the same table, joined as host and
guest, after all that had passed between them.
But Priam's eyes were exceeding heavy, for he
had hardly closed them in slumber since the awful
day when he saw Hector stricken to death before
his sight; and after tasting a morsel he begged
Achilles to show him the place where he was to rest.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Priam's bed was laid under the portico which
ran round the outside of the dwelling, for fear lest
any chance visitor to Achilles should see him if
he lay within.  Overcome by weariness, he soon fell
into a deep sleep.  But in the dead of night he
was roused by the voice of Hermes, whose watchful
eye had never left him, and who now came to
warn him of the perils by which he was surrounded.
What if Agamemnon should hear that the King
of Troy was lying asleep in the midst of the Grecian
camp!  All the wealth of Troy would hardly
suffice to ransom such a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
Priam rose in haste, now fully alive to his
danger, and found the horses ready harnessed,
and IdÃ¦us waiting with the mule car.  The same
powerful hand which had brought them to the
dwelling of Achilles now smoothed the way for
their return, and day was just breaking as they
crossed the ford of the river.
</p>

<p>
The first to observe their coming was Cassandra,
a daughter of Priam, who was watching from the
highest tower of the citadel; and the report soon
spread throughout the city that Priam was returning,
bringing with him the body of Hector.  Then not
a man nor a woman was left in the city, but all with
one accord streamed out through the gates to meet
the strange procession.  There was seen Hecuba,
the mother of the slain, leaning on the shoulder of
Andromache, his faithful wife; and following them
at a distance, with downcast eyes, avoiding the looks
of hate which were cast at her, went the fatal Helen.
During all the years that she had lived as an
unwelcome guest in the house of Priam, Hector had
never reminded her by a look or a word of the
miseries which she had brought on his country.
He was all gentleness, all goodness, even to her,
who had sinned so grievously against him and his
people; and when hard words were aimed at her
by any of his kinsfolk his patience and charity had
ever been her shield.
</p>

<p>
By the authority of Achilles a truce of eleven
days was granted to the Trojans to celebrate the
obsequies of Hector.  For nine days he lay in the
chamber prepared for him in the palace, and all the
city was given up to mourning.  On the tenth day
they buried him, and on the eleventh they raised
his monument.
</p>

<p>
And so, after long delay, that knightly spirit
passed into its rest.
